But I think I am not like other first time users. Instead\nof going with Ubuntu as it is the most popular distro, I started with Debian stable. And yes, of course it has\noutdated packages which for me at that time was not relevant as I only need it for mundane tasks such as\nwriting documents and moving files around. After a few months, I distrohopped to Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Artix, Manjaro\nand on the New Year of 2021, I hopped to Arch and stayed there for 6 months. The reason I found myself in\nrolling release distros is that I want to have the latest bleeding edge software. However, the desktop\nexperience between different release models seems to be similar nor different. Because the fundamentals of a desktop\nis for it to be used as one with the most basic of software. However, I am not saying there are no flaws\nusing Linux as a desktop.\nLinux as a desktop§\n\nDesktop Linux is not as popular. However, just because it's not as popular, it does not mean that it is not usable.\nDuring my first time using Debian and ignoring the fact that the installer menu is very dated, the desktop experience was alright and I have not experienced some funky\nthings except that the software there is always outdated in Debian stable. Given the simplicity of my use cases\nfor a desktop e.g. web browsing, writing documents, and moving files around, it seems using Linux as a desktop\nis not really a problem for me. But for those that want to use Photoshop, well tough luck, you are on your own\nas those proprietary software do not really support linux. But hey, if you have old hardware, Linux is your only\nchoice unless you want to try the BSDs.\nOkay, so are there any problems?§\n\nNo software is perfect nor any concept is ideal. Free and open source software is one and this affects desktop\nLinux adoption.\nDesktop Linux is dependent on the Desktop Environment§\n\nI can't simply not emphasize this one.\n\nYour desktop environment in Linux can actually determine your overall\ndesktop Linux experience.\n\nA desktop environment in Linux is basically a set of desktop tools from related toolkits that create a full\ndesktop experience. Popular desktop environments include\n\nKDE Plasma. Based on the QT Toolkit.\nGNOME. Based on GTK Toolkit\nXFCE. Based on GTK as well.\n\nSo why is this important? Because some users blame the distribution of Linux that they're using instead of\nthe desktop environment. And thus, they can be deceiving for newcomers because newcomers will think distro X is bad\nbecause distro Y has this, when they are actually just comparing GNOME over KDE Plasma.\n\nHaving many choices is a double-edged sword, it's the same on desktop environments\n\nBut it does not mean we should just keep it at that. We should educate newcomers that it's the desktop environment\nthey are looking and not the distribution. So instead of suggesting them to \"use Arch linux\" just for the superiority\ncomplex, suggest them KDE Plasma and tell them GNOME sucks because it does not have a system tray. *Pitch forks flying where?*\nAnother disclaimer: Just because I hate this part of GNOME, does not mean I hate GNOME as a whole. It's just a joke with added\nhint of truth 😛\nSo my take here is, use the desktop environment you are more familiar with and you find the most intuitive to use.\nSoftware availability can be brittle§\n\nOne thing I like about Linux is the amount of software availability. Want an office suite? Use Libreoffice.\nWant an image editor? Use GIMP or Krita. And there is no end to it. I think this in my opinion is what makes\nLinux a good choice in using it as a desktop. However, although it's an advantage, remember that we are talking\nabout free software. And free software can be brittle.\nThe problem with free and open source software§\n\n\nFreedom and free can be easily overly used and abused\n\nIt can be. I appreciate the efforts that are put into these software. But I have my reasons for why being\nfree can be a problem.\n\nSoftware availability does not equate to software quality\n\nYes. Just because it's available, it does not mean you get the quality you want like from proprietary software\nas well. Proprietary software can be low quality though. However, what I am saying is that, it is hard\nfor FOSS to achieve similar quality unless there are incentives.\nMoney, is undoubtly, one of the driving force to keep FOSS alive through funding. I remembered reading\nan article stating that GNOME was close to dying because of the lack of funding.\n\"But you are a FOSS enthusiast right?\", I am and hear me out. I think the issue about being free\nis the fact that most people interpret free as in free beer. This means that people who\ncontribute and/or maintain FOSS software does not need any incentive... but oh boy they do 🥲. Lots of software\nare very slow to update, slow bug fixes which some can even span for a decade or two (yes that's true lmao), and\neven gets abandoned because people do not contribute and just selfishly demand the maintainers without thinking\nthat they made this software on their free time... And that free time is not compensated well enough and free\ntime is not free unless you are privileged enough. These factors lead to cause some open source maintainers\nto drop their project or become hostile to their users which promotes a toxic environment for both users and\nmaintainers. Overall, these issues affect the overall quality of the software, hence why people prefer PhotoShop\nover GIMP. Desktop environments are software as well so they are not excluded when it comes to these issues.\nThere are certain instances where a certain kind of desktop environment is very hostile to users.\n\nFree is not free beer\n\nSimilar articles are listed below, take it as a grain of salty salt.\n\nOpen source enshrines the wrong privilege\nOpen source has a people problem\n\n\"But you just linked two?\", dude I am not your nanny, formulate your own opinion by doing research and thru observations.\n\"But this is Linux as a desktop?\" and they are related to desktop Linux adoption 🙂.\nAdoption of desktop Linux is slow because reasons§\n\nHere is my take for why it is slow.\nSome people are tech-savvy enough to appreciate open source software and make Linux as their daily\ndriver and I kind of understand that. However, the reason the normies can't use Linux is that\nthe workflow, the setup, the software availability and the installation method for some software are\nunfamiliar to them.\nAdditionally, desktop Linux is more centered around seasoned developers and enthusiasts rather than\nthe common people. And most people buy computers with pre-installed operating systems which of course is Windows or MacOS given that\nLinux has a very small marketshare (around 1-2%). Those operating systems were designed\nfor those people and it is no surprise that desktop Linux will stay as obscure for another\ndecade or so unless they use the Steam Deck.\nProprietary and non-Linux software§\n\nThere is also an issue with using Windows software. Most of them are proprietary.\nAs most software for normies are targetted mostly for the two most popular operating systems,\nWindows and MacOS, some users have to go to various workarounds just to get their favorite software\nto work e.g. running through an emulation layer or through Wine or Proton.\nThis can be a bit annoying for those that do not want to learn those things as they want things to get\ndone asap.\nIn my honest opinion though, this is not the fault of Linux. It's more of like \"We don't want to include\nLinux builds for this X software because we generate less money there\" so it's a bit understandable\nbecause capitalism. *cough cough*\nIs it now normie friendly then?§\n\nThat kind of depends. Even the most desktop user friendly Linux distributions are not completely normie\nfriendly, starting from the installer to a fully installed setup. But I have to say that\nit kind of is. Linux has come so far from being a developer and an enthusiast only operating system\nto somewhat close to general user desktop operating system.\nI think it's kind of fortunate that there are an increasing number of enthusiasts and volunteers to\ncreate (or fork) Linux distributions and design them in a way that even those with little to no\ntechnical knowledge can install Linux. One good example is Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Fedora and some\nArch forks such as EndeavourOS and ArchCraft. However, the issue also arises during desktop usage\nwhere users complain about installing drivers, codecs, and other stuff that requires at least\nsome technical know-how to fix/install/debug them. So much for an out-of-the-box experience.\nHence, I am not going to say it's fully normie friendly but there is evidence of progress. This is\nmy honest opinion that desktop Linux requires a lot of patience and workarounds just to make it\nwork sometimes.\nFor instance, I have to install the flatpak software for my girlfriend\nsince it's the fastest way to get codecs built-in to the software e.g. Firefox. My girlfriend is\nnot a developer nor a programmer nor a tech enthusiast. Thus, I have to make her openSUSE\ninstallation as sane for her as much as possible.\nFYI§\n\nActually, I don't use a desktop environment as much as I used to, I always often use a tiling window manager such as\nSwayWM, RiverWM, and Hyprland. For me, it can be considered a desktop linux experience (so you can only blame yourself for having bad configuration or setup).\nHowever, these are for enthusiast power-users that like to configure everything down to the source code (such as DWM) and our topic\nis about desktop Linux for the normies so it's irrelevant.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/10/","title":"Is Linux (as a desktop) normie friendly already?"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/11/":{"body":"The Julia programming language has gained more improvements over the years. The latest\nversion as of writing is 1.9.0 - one of the biggest improvements of Julia in the 1.x series. Hoping more to come!\nWhat is Juliaup?§\n\njuliaup is a version manager for Julia much like pyenv or rbenv. It's functionality closely aligns with rustup.\nIf you want to know more, check out their github repository at https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup.\nWhy should you use Juliaup?§\n\nThe usual way of downloading release binaries at the official website is not really much of a hassle. However,\ndownloading different versions of Julia can take more time to browse around.\nThere are two version managers for Julia: jill.py and juliaup.\nAs you may have noticed, jill.py is a python script that installs Julia and juliaup is written in Rust. I cannot compare\ntheir differences as I never tried the former. I suggest you try either one of them.\nInstalling a Julia release channel in juliaup is quite easy. To check available channels, you run juliaup list. To add a channel, say 1.5.0,\nyou run juilaup add 1.5.1. To make a channel the default, you run juliaup default 1.5.0.\nFor me, you should use juliaup since it includes features such as the ability to run a version (as long as it is added)\nusing their own Julia caller called julialauncher. You can symlink or alias that as julia. For example, if you want to run version 1.6.0,\nyou can do so by running julialauncher +1.6.0 or julia +1.6.0.\nThere is plan in the future releases to make a duplicate launcher of julialauncher that is called julia. I do believe\nit will just add more confusion though. I just symlink it instead. But that is because juliaup has not been hosted\nyet on crates.io. See issue #639.\nAnything to improve?§\n\nI think a feature I want to have in juliaup is this one - https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup/issues/10.\nI do think that the idea of having juliaup.toml in the root directory of a project is convenient. Rust does that with rust-toolchain.toml. But again,\nit is up to debate because there were some issues of maybe duplicating the functionality of Project.toml and Manifest.toml and selecting the version\ninside those two configuration files mitigates that issue rather than using juliaup.toml. The workaround for now is to use\nthe JULIAUP_CHANNEL environmental variable with direnv or whatever env \"manipulation\" tool you use.\nAgain, if you want to explore juliaup, you can do so by checking first the repository at https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup.\nIf you use openSUSE, just run sudo zypper in juliaup and you are good to go.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/11/","title":"Juliaup is the next generation version manager for Julia"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/12/":{"body":"Ever thought of what linux distribution to choose? You are not alone.\nLinux (or GNU/Linux for the pedant 😛) has at least hundreds of different existing distributions. This\ngives users many distributions to choose from and the freedom to use their distribution of choice. This\nincludes the popular distros such as Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE, and Linux Mint and the most obscure such\nas Carbs Linux, Clear Linux, and some Arch derivative you never heard of before.\nHowever, this can also be confusing to newcomers (or even old users) alike because your distro of choice\ncan really matter when it comes to community support, maintenance, and also the life of the distribution\nbefore it f itself out of existence. This means that choosing the wrong distribution can result to\nunintended consequences for you as a user for areas in e.g. security, community, and support.\nThis nearly happened with Solus btw. The two posts summarizes what happened:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SolusProject/comments/ssps5j/i_no_longer_feel_safe_using_solus/\nA New Voyage - Solus Project\n\nGood thing it's back 😄. I don't use Solus though. But what can we learn from this btw as a user? And how\ndoes this affect our decision to choose a distribution? Is choosing a distribution really matter?\nUnfortunately, the short answer is yes. You can skip btw but if you want to read more I have some\nimportant points to take why this is so.\nYour distribution of choice really matters§\n\nIt's painfully obvious that your distro of choice really matters. There are many factors to consider\nwhen choosing a distro. Choosing the \"right\" distro for you is very subjective but here are the factors\nyou really need to consider:\n\nDocumentation and Wiki\nCommunity\nSoftware Availability\nLongevity\n\nDocumentation and Wiki§\n\nWhy is this first mentioned than the other sections? Because good documentation and a wiki can help both\nold and new users to hop over a distro. Badly written or no documentation at all can be a reason why\ncertain distros will never have any new users at all. Beginner-friendly distros are \"beginner friendly\"\nfor a reason. That's because they have good documentation on how to install, use, and maintain their\nsystem. Even hard-core \"do it yourself\" distros such as Arch or Gentoo are popular because they have\nan informative Wiki where anyone can contribute or improve existing information.\nA special mention for FreeBSD, as it is one of my favorite non-linux\ndistribution with great documentation and manual. Easy to understand and grasp.\nSadly, I really cannot daily drive it because some software work only on Linux. I do hope you try it out!\nCommunity§\n\nWhat makes a Linux (or a BSD) distribution stay alive for years and years? What keeps it afloat? And what\nkeeps it thriving still in the future?\nIt's actually the community behind your favorite distribution.\nGrowing interest and usage of a distribution helps maintain motivation from both project contributors and\ncommunity members. However, incentives are actually needed to keep both the distribution and community thriving.\nThis is shown to be true to most corporate and community backed distributions such as Fedora (from RHEL),\nand openSUSE (from SUSE). With no incentives such as funding and through donations, it is really hard\nfor a community to stay alive, and again, this nearly happened to Solus.\nThis is important as well in choosing your distribution because you are given the assurance to stick to that\ndistribution without worrying that it will someday become a dead project and a dead community.\nSoftware Availability§\n\nThis is very self-explanatory really. Your distribution of choice may not have the software you use when you were\nin another distribution. This can be fixed by helping contribute to the distribution itself by volunteering to\npackage the software you usually use. I don't think there should be an issue about that but it is up to you\nif you have the time to do that. No one is forcing you to contribute. The idea of giving back should be encouraged\nthough.\nFortunately, packaging formats such as flatpak and snap bridge the\nissues with software availability. I definitely recommend flatpak over snaps though as flatpaks are truly\nplatform-agnostic unlike Canonical's snap 🤮. No to AppImage, I will write a blog about that soon.\nLongevity§\n\nHow long does a distribution last? New distributions are born nearly every year or so but the question remains. What\nkeeps a distribution's existence last for decades?\nThe answer is very simple. Time and money. Unfortunately, free software is not actually free as you would like it to be.\nContributors and project maintainers alike need some form of incentive for them to keep a project alive. *They gotta eat\nand sleep too you know...\nSmall time distributions rarely last a year or two before they become dead (insert another Arch-derivative meme here).\nThese kinds of distros rarely last because there are no incentives and additionally, they are usually hobby projects or\nprojects that only focus on a niche.\nCorporate-backed and community-backed distros are on the clear because they have the means and incentives to do so.\nIt is also why I always recommend distributions such as Fedora or openSUSE.\nConclusion§\n\nChoosing a Linux distribution can be confusing. Sometimes joining the popular is the safest option to take. Other times, you\njust want to try obscure distros just to be different. To be honest, preference is preference. Whether you like pineapple\non pizza or not, it is up to you to choose a distro. However, ignoring the factors I mentioned to choose a distribution that\nyou want to use daily can affect your productivity and time. If you really want to try out a distribution and test it out,\nI suggest run it inside a container or virtual machine. Explore and hop around until the shoe fits 😀.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/12/","title":"How should you choose a distro?"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/13/":{"body":"Update on my current usage§\n\nI stopped using it. MicroOS has some of it's perks but the current state of the operating system is still in it's beta/alpha state\nso some moving parts are inherently broken. It's probably because of the lack of contributors and interest from SUSE and openSUSE\nfor the desktop variant of MicroOS. As much as I want to become a contributor, I realize I lack the time to do so because\nof work and personal problems and issues I still have to fix a lot in real life. If you still want to know how I use it, continue reading.\n\nMicroOS Desktop is a desktop variant of the openSUSE's MicroOS for servers and containerized workflows. Please do note, although they are\nsimilar, they are separate products and have different goals.\n\nIssues in MicroOS for server should be issued over there and issues in MicroOS Desktop\nshould be on MicroOS Desktop.\n\nThe goal of the desktop is as follows:\n\nimmutability\nisolation of system and user software\ncontainerized workflows\n\nImmutability§\n\nImmutable desktops are nothing new. Windows and MacOS are immutable desktops since you cannot\nchange the core part of the system unless you have some permissions and workarounds to do it e.g.\nmodifying the system registry. For years, this was the standard of modern OSses including Android.\nTraditional desktop linux and nix systems are mutable which means that the user can modify\neach part of the core system. Although this advantage is also a disadvantage, nothing is perfect.\nAdvantages of an immutable system§\n\nBeing immutable is inherently an advantage of an immutable desktop system. It is hard to\nmodify the core part of the system and updates are \"atomic\" which means the whole system\nwill update as an immutable system.\nUsers are encouraged to use workflows through sandboxing or containers. In this case, flatpaks,\nnix, distrobox, toolbx, docker and podman.\nFor desktop software, it is advisable to use flatpaks. Some users do use toolbx and distrobox for this.\nFor development environment, they are encouraged to use distrobox and toolbx. Others may prefer nix.\nDisadvantages§\n\nBeing immutable may also be a disadvantage. It's very self-explanatory. You cannot modify\nyour system as much as you like to.\nSecurity§\n\nImmutable desktops increases security of the core system since it's not welcoming any modifications.\nSince the root file system is read-only, it's not easy to tamper the system and thus, users\ncan avoid any vulnerabilities unless the vulnerability is from the package and software installed\nfrom the root file system.\nMy Workflow§\n\nFor software that I want to use e.g. Firefox, flatpaks are the way to go. Flatpaks are the best\nwhen it comes to these kind of distributions as they are self-contained and do not pollute\nthe host system with ridiculously brittle and large dependencies when installing through\nthe system's package manager.\nFor developing and packaging software and also for learning, and note taking, I use distrobox.\nHow I use distrobox§\n\nI created mainbox executable.\n\nThis is for my development environment such as notetaking, learning a new language, or programming tasks.\nI also created rootbox executable.\n\nThis is for openSUSE Build Service related stuff since I am a volunteer packager there. I also set\nthe --home flag when creating this podman container. The --home flag helps you have a custom\n$HOME inside your container. It avoids clutter on your actual home directory.\nConclusion§\n\nFor now, I am still new to MicroOS Desktop and I still experience some bugs here and there because\nI use the KDE Plasma variant of MicroOS which is known to be still in it's alpha stage. This\nmeans, it's not yet considered for daily use even though some users are now using it. To help\nimprove the experience, it's best to file bug reports and propose suggestions to the MicroOS\nPlasma Desktop maintainers and contributors. If you are privileged to have the free time to\ncontribute, consider offering your skills and services as well.\nTroubleshooting§\n\nBlurry fonts on KDE Plasma§\n\nInstall all the xdg-desktop-portal implementations especially gnome and gtk. Blurry fonts are usually affecting\ngtk apps and not qt apps.\nIssues§\n\nNVIDIA drivers don't load as fast causing some issues with the login manager. Workarounds is a force systemctl restart display-manager.service.\nI am not sure what's causing it as there are no logs. This does not happen on vanilla openSUSE TumbleWeed.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/13/","title":"How I use MicroOS Desktop"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/14/":{"body":"The Julia programming language is a popular general programming language where the\ncommunity leans more on scientific computing. And like most programming languages, Julia code\ncan be written on most text editors such as IDEs.\nMost editors today contain a set of tools such as git integration, built-in terminal, and a\nfile picker and finder. Some editors that I tried are of the following:\n\nVisual Studio Code\nVim\nNeovim\nEmacs\n\nSetting up Julia LSP for Helix§\n\nHelix is a new editor I daily drive since a year ago. It follows a different style of\nediting than Vim/Neovim. It's model and keymaps are influenced from Kakoune which\nfollows a select-action-execute model unlike the usual Vim action-select-execute model. I've been\nliking it so far!\nAs this post is about setting up LSP for Helix, setting up LSPs on other editors are\npretty straight-forward e.g. Julia plugin on VSCode.\nWith helix, you have to write a simple configuration, specifically at languages.toml.\nWriting the Julia LSP script for the LSP§\n\nAs helix does not have the option to pass the value of the current working directory of the file or buffer\n(maybe I am wrong, do correct me though!) unlike neovim's %:p:h, our script is like so:\n\nTo understand what it's doing, the main focus of this script is actually the project_path variable. We first\ncheck if there is a JULIA_PROJECT environmental variable, explicitly set by the user. Base.load_path_expand\nachieves this. If there is none or if it is empty e.g. empty string, return nothing.\nIf the previous returns nothing, we use the Base.current_project(pwd()). And if it does not detect\na Project.toml file from the current directory, we will fallback to Pkg.Types.Context().env.project_file\nand Base.active_project().\nThe project_path variable is very important as this will help us check which project you are in and\nwhere to run the LSP.\nJulia's LSP is provided by LanguageServer.jl. But\nI don't like installing it on the global environment, hence, we have the ls_install_path variable.\nThis ls_install_path variable assumes that you have installed the language server on one of the many DEPOT_PATH.\nHere, I assumed it has to be at ~/.julia/environments/helix-lsp. We need this variable because we need to\nadd that path to the LOAD_PATH. You can check what LOAD_PATH is in the Julia REPL. Basically, it's just an\narray of paths where we load our environment for using and import statements. By default, it has a path\nto the global environment. This is why I have to add the popfirst! function since I don't want to use that one.\ndepot_path and symbol_server_path are optional but I like to make sure that JULIA_DEPOT_PATH exists.\nLastly, we then initialize the server by setting the LanguageServerInstance and setting the linter to true. We\nthen run the run function with the server.\nAdding it to language.toml§\n\nOnce we are done, we can finally either add it to a script file that can be executed within your PATH or just plain\nexecute it like julia --project=@helix-lsp path/to/scriptfile.jl.\nHere is a sample:\n\nIt is up to you if you want to use PackageCompiler.jl to create a sysimage and make the LSP faster. Fortunately,\nyou don't really need it since version 1.9.0 is very fast now.\nThere is runserver, why not use that?§\n\nThere are some gotchas with using runserver. If I can recall correctly, my issue was it cannot detect the correct paths\ninside helix and my script for neovim and kakoune is to detect where the file is located and if the location contains Project.toml or Manifest.toml\nand set it as the env_path. This can be seen with my kak-lsp julia config at line 168-170\non the default kak-lsp.toml\nAs you may noticed, it's not in the script we have discussed before this section. So I probably must have forgotten why\nI wrote that script only to end up that there is no way to check the path to the buffer or file. Therefore, I recommend to run helix within the root\nof your Julia project.\nLet me know if you are not experiencing any issues with runserver since someone suggested that it works\nperfectly fine now.

The problem with popular social media today is its effects on healthy social dynamics.\nA false ideal on what we expect between relationships with friends, family, and our partners is one thing.\nAssuming you are friends or you know much about an idol, a streamer, or an actress - what we call \"parasocial\"\nrelationships - is getting out of hand. We value the superficial instead of those who are honest, and real to\nus.\nWe should value the people who were with us during our struggles, who hurt us for our own good and improvement\nand who love us despite of our flaws.\n\nBecause saying \"I love you\" hurts more when it starts to flicker.\n\nWhy \"it\" matters§\n\nBecause life is fleeting and we only have one life. It's a sad truth we really cannot avoid\nbecause the continuous chemical reactions to keep us alive is finite. Time is a very scarce resource, it's\nquite ironic that time itself is infinite but scarce for us.\nWhat you should do§\n\nSpread your knowledge, wisdom and time with those that matter. Regret only happens when you keep thinking\nabout the past like things you didn't do but wanted to do.\nLove yourself more and share that love to others. Learn more and share your knowledge and wisdom. Ignore\nhate if you can, and appreciate what's important. Value your time, and value your life.

Like any\nLinux distribution, it provides loads of quality software for many users and\nsupports modern systems.\nTry out openSUSE by following the link https://get.opensuse.org.\nWhen I hopped over to openSUSE§\n\nIT WAS NOT GOOD. Keyword \"was\". Hear me out. I tried out openSUSE around the year 2020.\n\nI joined openSUSE Discord but left as soon as I realized the mirror situation. I complained\nlike a lot. The distribution is actually very good. I just don't want to live in\na time where I suffer from slow updates. It's why I came back to Manjarno.\nBut before we get into the part where I hopped back to openSUSE, let me talk about the\nbrief history of my Linux journey.\nMy Linux Journey§\n\nSo my Linux journey started around the year 2019 when the COVID-19 pandemic happened. My old laptop became slow around that\ntime. To save money and to avoid the cost of buying a new laptop, we bought replacement parts and while waiting for them to\narrive, I decided to try Linux on the month of May of 2020. Windows 10 became so slow on my old machine and I was thinking,\n\"I know I am smart enough to read books and manuals, so why not Linux?\". I got my flashdrive, downloaded\nDebian Stable, burned the ISO to the flashdrive through Rufus and then just basically\nwiped Windows and replaced it with Debian. I was pretty sure the first DE I tried was KDE Plasma.\nThe distributions I tried are actually enough for writing, presenting, and schooling!\nArch Linux for the new year of 2021§\n\nI was very curious of Arch Linux and the hype around the distribution.\nIt turns out, the appealing aspect of Arch was the fact that you can modify and install what you\nwant on this distribution. I daily drived it with some hopping over to other *nix distributions of course (such\nas FreeBSD which is not a linux distribution).\nThe rest of the stuff is distrohopping 🤦‍♂️§\n\nI mean if we want to breakdown all the distros I tried, not just Linux, here it is:\n\n2020\n\nDebian\nXubuntu\nManjaro\nArtix\n\n\n2021\n\nArch\nVoid\nFedora\nFreeBSD\n\n\n\nIn 2022, I daily drived Void Linux from January to June-ish. Once my new laptop arrived, I then just full hopped on Fedora,\nonly to be disappointed, I forgot what it was though. Went to Arch for a little bit. Then I came back top openSUSE.\nI hopped back to openSUSE. Twice.§\n\nIt was 2021. I hopped back to openSUSE and uh, the mirror situation was still not great. I will have to time it every late at night just\nfor an update to complete by the next day... imagine that...\nBut I persevered. It's annoying enough to hop back and forth only because of the mirrors but I believed and hoped that\nimprovements of the mirror situation. And someone did improve it!!!\nFirstyear steps in§\n\nI tried many mirrors around and I was not very happy. Many times, I either get an outdated mirror or a dead mirror.\nFirstyear was one of the victims of the mirror situation. I think at that time, he was\nexploring some ways on how to fix the mirror issue. Because he is not just a user, the mirror situation affected\nhis work. tl;dr he works at SUSE LLC and mirrors were bad.\nHere are some screenshots of our conversation in openSUSE Discord regarding mirrors:\nI was probably a few days late for an update but oh well...\n\n\nBasically, he just did a Thanos move.\n\nIt took a while. Or more like a year before it has improved.\nTook a while§\n\nIt did took another year after that because there were still some rough edges.\nSo I came back to Void for quite a while until 2022 happened. I came back again for openSUSE for the reason that I feel\nlike I do not really belong in the Void community. I felt at home to openSUSE so it's why I came back. And I came back with\nimproved infrastructure because Firstyear and co-contributors finally solved the mirror issue!\n\nAnd I stayed using openSUSE until the time I was writing this. 😳\nWhy openSUSE ?§\n\nopenSUSE is a very underrated distribution. I don't care much about the controversies for why that is, people like to gossip including myself :P\nAnyway, I chose openSUSE because for many reasons but here are the major ones.\nEasier to contribute§\n\nUnlike other distros that I tried, openSUSE seems to be open on encouraging users to contribute in various parts of the distribution from\nthe openSUSE Build Services, the openSUSE Wiki, and packaging.\nI learned mostly about packaging because it's that area that I am most interested in when I tried openSUSE. Firstyear taught me about\nthe RPM specification and RPM specfiles. As of writing, I managed to package at least 10 software, mostly related to Rust or Wayland such\nas mdbook, swww, and xdg-desktop-hyprland.\nAmazing community§\n\nI met lots of talented and skilled individuals in openSUSE that I really just want to steal their brain and make theirs mine.\nThere are a lot of people as well that are humorous and funny to a point I really like to lurk there sometimes.\nBut again, that's because we have amazing moderators.\nI learned a lot§\n\nWhen I joined openSUSE, I learned lives of different people there and met some fellow people who use different kind of\nOSes. I learned about their perspectives in the tech community. And I think being in openSUSE really opened my eyes\nthat there is much more than \"free\" and \"open-source software\". Various people have different reasons of using Linux.\nWould I still use openSUSE forever?§\n\nDepends. Maybe in the future my needs may become entirely different. I have been eyeing on reproducibility\nwhere I can predict my current setup is the same across different machines such as NixOS and other immutable\ndistributions such as openSUSE Aeon and Fedora Silverblue.\nBut I won't forget about the openSUSE community ☺️\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/16/","title":"Journey to openSUSE"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/2/":{"body":"In this blog post, I will discuss why I found myself falling in love in federated social networking than the mainstream social media websites such as birdsite and zucksite.\nThe issue§\n\nFor a long time, I must admit that I am no stranger to be in the internet like everyone else. I usually just scroll and scroll. But there is one thing that bugs me all the time\nwhen I was in birdsite or zucksite: the algorithm. Most folks call this the algorithm so let's just stick to that for now.\nSo we already know what this algorithm does to most of us right? Posts that have a significant number of follows, reposts and likes are more likely to be seen than others which means\nengagements feel more unnatural and is designed to increase chances for the user to feel the surge of dopamine and thus, it's why social media addiction is quite prevalent in this age.\nAnd that's not the only problem. For example, if a misinformation has more likes, reposts and follows than those that are factual, scientically-backed and peer-reviewed information, then a lot of people usually\nagree on the former than the latter posing so many problems in the scientific communication and bringing factual information. This is evident during the COVID-19 pandemic and we all know what happened so let's stop there.\nMainstream social media for a long time is still vulnerable to political propagandas, health quacks, and scientific misinformation that it already became a headache to various experts on how to mitigate this problem.\nAlso, we users are victims to those problems and I doubt that will go away anytime soon.\nBut what about privacy?[1] That's another issue that's been repeated over from other blog posts of other people so we all know the gist here. I do value privacy, but the only issue with these is I have families, friends, and colleagues that use zucksite and birdsite.\nTherefore, I really cannot leave this sites. As much as I want to convince them, they cannot just jump ship because they are used to it because these sites make people lazy after all. The only solution is to\nlessen the amount of info you can give to these sites but I do think I already gave them enough that they can profile me since my accounts are as old as me. lol\nFresh air§\n\nI noticed mastodon after I was looking for privacy alternatives around the summer[2] of 2021. If I can remember correctly, I joined\ntypes.pl around the time when I explored around. I saw an acquaintance of mine joined so I was interested so I joined as well.\nWhat I noticed was, it was actually so dead. I apologize for those that are offended but it was. Keyword: was 😉. While exploring the new site, I was also on birdsite.\nBirdsite for a long time has started to show its signs of becoming a cesspool of garbage and tar. Thankfully, my follows and followers are just those people\nI know. But like I said, it showed signs of becoming a cesspool of garbage. Let me correct myself, it was for a long time a cesspool of hate.\nMisinformation, racism, antivaxx, there are too many to count, I actually lessened my activity on birdsite and just read blogs from people instead. I waited for the day until Space Karen[3]\ngot baited to buy it. And that's when I finally jumped over.\nMastodon and others that interact with ActivityPub e.g. Misskey, have similarities with the mainstream social media. But there are differences:\n\nFederated instances\nNo algorithm\nHashtags\n\nFederated instances§\n\nUnline most mainstream social media, federated social networks such as mastodon is not owned by a single usually corporate entity. They are from community of volunteers or from a single person\nof whom hosts those federated instances using their own money and resources. That's why if you have the money, please do donate to your instances. They are usually doing it for free.\nBecause they are not owned by a single entity, there is also a concept of defederation where instances are blocked from at least one instance because of disagreements or abuse. This means that\nany crappy instance that are defederated are more likely to become isolated from other instances and die. In birdsite, you cannot do that and thus, some piece of garabage will slip through your home feed sooner or later\neven after you block some toxic people. It does not mean that it's true to most instances, it kind of depends on your instance admin and owner so if your admin does not\ndo anything after all the abuse, you can just hop over on another instance.\nNo algorithms and Hashtags§\n\nNo algorithms, it's self-explanatory. Because of this, federated social networks feel very unusual for those that migrated from birdsite and zucksite.\nUsers are encouraged to boost to gain visibility. And also, the use of hashtags is recommended so they can follow a topic they want. And it is etiquette to add Content Warnings\nfor your posts and captions for your photos for those that have visual and hearing impairment.\nConclusion§\n\nIt is really a breath of fresh air. I do not have to fear of replying to people because of the number of followers that they have or engagements nor do I have to care\nanymore about repost and likes counts. Because federated social networks encourage users to discuss, and talk rather than focusing their energy on needless clout.\nThus, I think I will stay in Mastodon for quite a long time 😄\n\n\nPrivacy is relative. As long as you are on the internet, you are not completely private.

If you prefer SSH, the full commands are\n\nOne can check that the remote for the repository is set properly by\nrunning the following command.\n\nBy default, it's named as origin. Your output could look like this\n\nNow that everything is setup, let's create an index.html at the root\ndirectory of the project.\n\nOpen and edit it with your editor. I use kakoune.\nCopy this simple HTML code below to your new file index.html.\n\nThis should suffice.\nSetting Up Your PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN§\n\nTo setup your Personal Access Token (PAT), you must be logged in to your\nGitHub account. Then head over to https://github.com/settings/apps.\nYou should see an option \"Personal access tokens\". Click that button.\nYou should get a drop down with some options. Click \"Tokens (classic)\".\nIn the upper-right, you can see the \"Generate new token\" button. Click that.\nYou should get a drop down with some options. Click \"Generate new token (classic)\".\nYou will be redirected to either enter your password or TOTP for 2FA. Please enter\nwhat was asked.\nName your TOKEN to whatever you want e.g. \"simple-site\". Feel free to set the expiration\ndate of the TOKEN.\nYou will also see a lot of scopes. Just select the one with [ ] repo Full control of private repositories.\nThis will give full control for both private and public repositories that you have.\nNow on the bottom-right, click the \"Generate token\" button. You will be redirected with a\none time copy of the token. Copy or write it down somewhere safe.\n⚠️ Be careful not to share your token once it's generated.\nSetting Up GitHub Workflows§\n\nNow, in your local repository, create a directory .github/workflows/.\n\nCreate a new file called pubish.yml at .github/workflows/.\n\nCopy the following code snippet to your publish.yml.\n\nEnsure you have replaced the following\n\n\"youremail\" should be your email address\n\"yourusername\" should be your username e.g. username for GitHub account\n\nBe careful with the indentations as YAML can be quite confusing.\nNow before pushing to your remote repository, you have to set your TOKEN\nas a GitHub secret in your repository. You should head to the link like\n\nReplace first the \"yourusername\" with your username on GitHub before\ncopying it and pasting it on your browser.\nYou will see two options once you head to the webpage\n\nEnvironment secrets\nRepository secrets\n\nChoose the one with Repository secrets and click \"New repository secret\". You will\nbe redirected to a page where you will input your TOKEN. Set the name as \"TOKEN\".\nThen paste the value of your PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN.\nOnce set, click \"Add secret\" button.\nLastly, add and commit your local changes and push it to your remote repository.\n\nYour site will now be at https://yourgithubusername.github.io/simple-site\nwhere yourgithubusername is your GitHub username. You should see\na \"Hello World!\" on your browser.\nSee the source repository for how we did it at https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/simple-site.\nConvenient Static Site Generators§\n\nAt this point, you already know how to setup and deploy a webpage. However,\nwriting a complex webpage with pure HTML can be tedious.\nThat's where static site generators come into the picture.\nThere are many popular static site generators to choose from such as\n\nHugo\nZola\nAstro\n\nFor this part of the tutorial, you are going to use zola, a simple static\nsite generator written in Rust.\nFirst create a new repository named \"ssg-site\".\nClone it locally and change directory into the ssg-site directory.\nAn example command will look like this. This uses SSH as the remote repository.\nAdjust to your configuration.\n\nReplace \"yourusername\" with your GitHub username.\nThen you must install zola. Follow installation instructions\nhere.\nInitialising Zola§\n\nRun the following command at the root directory of the project.\n\nIt will ask you the following questions.\nFor the first question\n\nWhat is the URL of your site? (https://example.com):\n\nYou should input the following format https://yourusername.github.io/ssg-site where\n\"yourusername\" is your GitHub username.\nThe next question will be\n\nDo you want to enable Sass compilation?\n\nType \"Y\" then press Enter.\nThe third question will be\n\nDo you want to enable syntax highlighting?\n\nType \"Y\" then press Enter.\nThe last question will be\n\nDo you want to build a search index of the content?\n\nFeel free to type \"Y\" or \"N\". It does not matter yet, unless in the future, you want\nyour site to have a search bar.\nYou have finally setup your Zola configuration. Now try running the command\n\nIt should serve your webpage locally at http://127.0.0.1:1111. It might change if another\nhas already parked that port.\nBut our site is still bland. Let's proceed adding a theme.\nSetting Up Zola Theme§\n\nZola has many cool themes. You can check the theme collection at https://www.getzola.org/themes/.\nLet's use anemone, one of my favourite themes in Zola.\nAt the root directory of your project, run the following command.\n\nThis should create a git submodule in your project.\nNow open and edit your config.toml. It should look like the following.\n\nReplace \"yourusername\" with your GitHub username. Save the file.\nYour webpage will reload and it will be an empty page with a footer. The colors\nare new as well because of the theme.\nAdding some content§\n\nNow that our theme is up, let's add some content. At the root directory of your project,\nhead to content directory. Create a new markdown file _index.md. Now copy and paste\nthis Lorem ipsum to _index.md file.\n\nThen run the following commands.\n\nTo understand what these files do, _index.md serves as the \"home\" page. It will\nlist our posts such as 1.md.\nNow try to edit _index.md such as an introduction about yourself and what you do.\nThen edit 1.md with your new goals in life or tips and tricks.\nOnce satisfied, let's finally deploy your site to GitHub Pages.\nDeploying to GitHub Pages§\n\nAt this point, you can either regenerate a new TOKEN or use the previous one you\nhave created from simple-site. Let's just assume you already have a TOKEN.\nFirst, run this command at the root directory of your project.\n\nThis should ignore the generated public directory. You should always do this\nbecause otherwise, you will end up having duplicated files unless you have other\nplans. The public directory is only created when you run this command.\n\nNext, add the new TOKEN as a Repository secret. You can repeat the steps you did on how to add\na new TOKEN to your repository like in the simple-site.\nHere is the fun part. Do the following commands.\n\nThen edit your publish.yml file which is located at .github/workflows/ with the following code.\n\nEnsure you change \"yourusername\" to your GitHub username and \"youremail\" to the email you are using for your GitHub account.\nSave the file. Now run the following command to add and commit your changes, then push.\n\nNotice that in the YAML file, it uses a custom image. That's because that\nlinux distribution image, Tumbleweed, already has an updated version of zola.\nOnce your site has been generated in the GitHub actions, you can head over to this link format\nyourusername.github.io/ssg-site where \"yourusername\" is your GitHub username.\nFeel free to use this or learn and use other SSGs to prettify your blogs and web pages!\nFAQ§\n\n\nI noticed that you didn't use a GitHub action plugin shalzz/zola-deploy-action@master. Why?\n\nIf you know the process, then you can trust yourself more than some random plugin. Not saying they could not be trusted\nbut you have to weigh your risks\n\nYou already know how to deploy, then you are more sure that you can trust yourself.\nTrust is a spectrum.\n\nTherefore, I don't need someone's tool if I already know how to do things. It's for the security side of things since\nGitHub actions can be a potential attack surface.\n\nOkay that's a wrap.

Although the idea was to use that, I never really got the motivation\naround that time to build my website since personal life got so busy.\nDiscovering Zola§\n\nAs a Rust enthusiast, I was finding myself looking around using tools that are written in Rust.\nWe all know about the memes such as \"Blazingly fast! 🚀\" on most popular Rust repositories but\nmy discovery of Zola, admittedly, is because of well... Rust. I have completely forgotten about\nFranklin.jl at that time, around October 2022 because the community I was in were Rust enthusiasts.\nLike Hugo, Zola is also a static site generator but written in Rust. It uses the\nTera templating engine which is inspired by Jinja2 and Django template language. As I am also familiar with Django,\nalbeit out of practice and no longer using it, I am still familiar with the Jinja2 and Django template language.\nI have not used Hugo so I cannot really tell what features it has compared to Zola. Zola has various features\nincluding a configuration file config.toml where you can configure if you want to generate a ToC. And of course, it\nsupports reading your static folder which you can put your assets and everything you want in there.\nThe appeal§\n\nThe number one appeal that I think what made me use Zola are templates. With the usage of the Tera\ntemplate language, you can reuse html files as ... guess what ... templates. This encourage code reuse and\nadding some macros so you can modify your existing templates with another and extending it as you please. As you may all\nknow, my site is built with Zola and I haven't even used its full power yet because I am still understanding\nhow this all works and all including extending and creating Tera macros. Yet, so little features used, and I already\nbuilt a website of my own. This made me happy and stick to it.\nConclusion§\n\nZola pretty well made it easy for me to write my own website and simplify my way of writing one with the Tera\ntemplating engine. So far, the tool is good to me and I have not experienced any hiccups yet.\nMinor issues§\n\nThe only issue that I really dislike about Zola is the lack of documentation, which to me discourages new users to use it.\nIt took me 2 hours to understand how to use the templating engine and what classes and ids should I use for the SASS/CSS files\nby inspecting the generated site using Firefox's Inspect tool and also reading code from custom themes from other users.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/3/","title":"My experience with Zola"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/4/":{"body":"Julia code that renders a Julia logo glyph which can only work perfectly with\nJuliaMono. Thanks cormullion! JuliaMono looks amazing!\n\nFor nearly 2 years, I have used Julia as my main hobby language of choice.\nI am not an expert nor a magician of this language but it really is a fun language\nto play with.\nAs a past Python user, Julia gave me a new perspective of languages I didn't know\nsince highschool. Features such as multiple dispatch, abstract types and composite\ntypes, I recently learned it in this language. I know there are a lot of blogs about\nJulia so how is this post any different? Let's dive in.\nCommunity§\n\nAs a person with no formal CS knowledge nor any in-depth understanding of CS theories at\nall, I am surprised that the Julia community welcomes any people from different backgrounds.\nI was very shy at first, but I was readily welcomed and with such a warm welcome,\nI was very enthusiastic to learn more about the language during my free time.\nThanks to aru, the Discord admin/dictator of Humans of Julia, I became a Community Lead/Moderator\nthere. Mark, Tom Kwong, Scott Jones, Ricardo Rosa, Franku, Aazare and Aaron where very active during the early days of\nHoJ. Unfortunately, due to work and personal stuff, most of these people are not as active\nas before. I do hope the energy to do so comes back but alas, I as well succumbed to that because of the same reason.\nNonetheless, there are other Julia communities too, and the one I lurk the most is\nin Julia Zulip.\nSo much to learn§\n\nEvery now and then when I lurk both in HoJ or in Julia Zulip, I met a lot of people who are more knowledgeable than me.\nClemapfel, also known as Clementine, was very helpful in the ask-for-help channels in HoJ. Clemapfel is\nthe author of jluna, a Julia-C++ wrapper. There is another\nperson too that I noticed that are actually so helpful, Yuuhi. I know there are others but every time\nI lurk, these are the two people I usually notice.\nThese people gave me more motivation to learn more about Julia even as to poke around the internals.\nBut my lack of C knowledge is the only thing that is holding me back. But I am not discouraged.\nI can learn Julia without knowing those and those gaps of knowledge, I can just ask around people the\nwhy's, what's, and how's of the language.\nAn ambitious project§\n\nI really want to learn Julia, that's why I plan to contribute as much as I can for the community and\nthe language even if it's just small issues on GitHub[1] or just helping newcomers in HoJ.\nI also as much as possible increase Julia's visibility on my favorite distribution, openSUSE, by\nbecoming a packager for Juliaup.\nBut one thing I still lack is a project I can call my own and proudly say I learned Julia\nthe best way possible - and that's  where SBOL3.jl comes in.\nI have not started anything yet on the project but I plan to do it around the March 2023. If you want to\nknow what SBOL is you can go to https://sbolstandard.org/\nSo far, there is nothing much I can say here since there is nothing significant progress on the project yet.\nPlanning to join a GSoC/JSoC to improve my Julia§\n\nI am planning to join GSoC/JSoC next year as a student. But the only issue is I get easily intimidated because\nI am not very bright and smart nor I have the necessary knowledge to tackle the projects.\nBut a friend of mine, William encouraged me to join\neven if I lacked some of the necessary knowledge because mentors exist for a reason. So yes, I decided\nto join GSoC/JSoC even if I don't have a very good base because I want to learn and I want to learn more.\nThanks again Firstyear for encouraging me and teaching me a lot of things in openSUSE 🥰\nConclusion§\n\nNow to end this in a positive note, I am really glad that I discovered this language. But it's not actually\nthe language that hooked me in, it was the helpful and knowledgeable people around me\nthat taught me a lot about being in a community and being a contributor. And that being passionate\nmeans there is so much more to learn and to love.\n\n\nI mainly use codeberg now but I still use my github account to contribute and star some projects. ↩\n\n\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/4/","title":"My experience with Julia"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/5/":{"body":"Tree-sitter is an incremental parsing system that allows developers to add syntax highlighting and tree-sitter regex search for easy navigation.\nThe project is heavily used among popular editors such as neovim, and helix.\nThe issue§\n\nAs a volunteer packager for openSUSE, I read rpm specfiles to add, update, and/or modify a package. It was fine with neovim at first but\nI use helix now as my main editor for modifying specfiles and for doing some changes.\nA comparison between helix right and neovim left:\n\nAs you can see from the image above, helix does not have a syntax highlighter for rpm. Neovim and Vim do but they do not use tree-sitter for\nthe highlighting of code. I am no expert of how neovim and vim do that without tree-sitter but I can link you to a blog which summarizes\nhow it works by implementing syntax highlighting for Bril.\nThis poses a problem§\n\nWell... for me, not sure for other people. The role of syntax highlighting is to allow us to see each part of the syntax\ndifferently e.g. function, module, variable, etcetera. This increases readability and the time to recognize parts of code\nis lessened to an extent. Although, it is not a big deal in most cases because RPM specfiles are usually less than 200 lines,\nit gets too complicated for packaging software that have different needs and limitations e.g. julia, and rust. Check out the specfiles for julia\nand rust and you will see what I mean.\nSolution§\n\nAgain, I mainly use helix now as my main editor. And helix does not have the same syntax highlighting functionality like vim's or neovim's.\nIt uses tree-sitter to do the syntax highlighting. Therefore, I have taken the initiative to write\nan RPM grammar for tree-sitter to solve my problems reading specfiles. For now the project is an\nempty repository - https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro/tree-sitter-rpm.\nI will update later in the future blogs on the progress of this.

Some people claim it received a little more users though but the trend seems to be saying otherwise:\n\nIs Firefox OK?\nFirefox Lost Almost 50 million users: Here's Why It is Concerning\nFirefox is great, so why has it lost almost 50 million users?\n\nand so forth...\nHowever, the losing of users are mostly caused by Mozilla's decisions over the years and I do think it's their\nfault for giving their browser an identity crisis plus controversial blog posts they posted that were really concerning\nfor some users.\n\nBut standards?\n\nStandards your mom\n\nSecurity (?)§\n\nI am no security expert but I believe both Chromium browser and Firefox has their own security issues. I just put it\nhere to let people know security is not a fixed solution, they are just layers of annoyances (like an onion) against any threat actor\nthat any user might not know they will come across. Nothing is fully secure.\nSo far, I have not experienced any hacks within my go-to web browser, Firefox 🙂.\nWayland§\n\nWith Wayland adoption increasing in every major linux distro, Firefox with native Wayland support enabled, never have failed me when I am using it\non a Wayland compositor be it GNOME, RiverWM, or SwayWM. Chromium-based browsers are weird on Wayland even with\nthat ozone flag thingy enabled 😅\n&gt; It is not popular as popular as Chromium-based browsers. There is Brave too, why are you still using it?§\n\nUh, ever heard of the word 'variety' and 'choices'? Also Brave is still Chromium under the hood with added\nBinance crypto and their own ads.\nAnd just because the browser is not as popular anymore, it does not mean it won't work with my daily\nstuff. Like, I have been using this browser for 2 years now and I only see minor hiccups but it never\nfailed me.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/8/","title":"Why am I still using Firefox?"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/9/":{"body":"Disclaimer§\n\nI really do not care what window manager or desktop environment you are using.\nFor me, it is stupid to start flame wars when it comes to things like these\nincluding editors and browsers. Because what the hell are you doing with life\nif you focus your energy on something so childish and unproductive?\nUse whatever fits for you, don't let others dictate what you use. Life is short 😄\nSo yeah - window managers go brrr...§\n\nI am a fan of using window managers especially those that have tiling and\nworkspace functionality. I experienced using many tiling window managers such\nas i3wm, swaywm, xmonad, and leftwm. And I used to daily drive riverwm,\na week before the time I am writing this.\nFor me, my motivations in using a window manager are the following criteria:\n\nSane configuration. I really dislike a configuration that requires you to\nlearn a programming language. I am looking at you XMonad.\nCommunity Support. If there are many users, then it's probably a good\nwindow manager.\nWiKi. What I Know Is.\nExtensibility\nMulti-Monitor support and mirroring.\nDynamic tiling with tabs support.\nWayland. Because it's the trend now on major distributions.\n\nBelow are the window managers/compositors that I listed to be potential for\nmy daily drive usage.\ni3§\n\nIt fits most of the the criteria except the part where it's\nnot Wayland and it does not have dynamic tiling by default (yes, you can use\na plugin for that but no... too much hassle).\nWayland is now the trend for\nmajor distributions such as openSUSE, Fedora, and Ubuntu. I really do not care\nmuch about the politics but the Xorg Foundation seems to be focused now on the\ndevelopment of Wayland as they claim that X11 and X server is technological\nburden that they don't want to maintain anymore as claimed by them.\n\nWayland is a replacement for the X11 window system protocol and architecture\nwith the aim to be easier to develop, extend, and maintain\n\nSo no for i3. 😥\nSway§\n\nWayland? Check. Dynamic tiling? No, but I don't want to install a plugin to add\ndynamic tiling.\n\"But that's just one thing?\". I do agree, however, Sway and other wlroots-based\nWayland compositors do not have proper multi-monitor support, especially the\npart where I can't mirror my output to an external display. It's a wlroots issue\nand I really can't blame the Wayland and Wlroots developers since they are\ndoing this in their free time even with tools such as wlr-randr and kanshi.\nRiver§\n\nThis was my daily driver and been using it since early February 2022. It's a\ndynamic tiling compositor with extensible layouts through the river-protocols\nspecifically river-layout-v3, therefore, you can make your own layout generator in\nany language. Notable layout generators that I have tried other than the default\nrivertile are rivercarro and stacktile. But as river is also a wlroots-based\nWayland compositor, I have the same issues that I have with sway on output mirroring.\nNow why Hyprland?§\n\nAs much as I love river, I have to use an external monitor (smart TVs and projector)\nevery weekdays for lectures because I am an instructor for a private university\nin the field of chemistry, and biology and some humanities-related subjects. This led me\nto use LeftWM as my dynamic tiler written in Rust.\nBut as it is not Wayland, I have to look for an alternative which has good external monitor\nsupport with output mirroring. LeftWM is great, but I can't remain maintaining two\ndotfiles...\nSo yes, I noticed Hyprland from one of my friends who also uses Wayland.\nIt was still beta at that time and I have heard many bugs so I was not really into it\nuntil someone packaged it in openSUSE Build Service and submitted it the openSUSE Wayland project\nand openSUSE Factory project. That led me to try it and package xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland\nin my own openSUSE Build Service project and install Hyprland.\nFeatures§\n\nHyprland has the following features (maybe I miss some of them but whatever):\n\nIPC support\nDynamic tiling by default\nHyprland protocols\nPortals\nGlobal Shortcuts\n\nBecause Hyprland has IPC support, this means users can create their own way to communicate\nand control the compositor. I rarely use this feature even in Sway because I just use usually\nwhat it brings on the table by default. It's also dynamic tiling and supports two kinds of layouts:\n\nDwindle\nMaster (and stack)\n\nI love the Dwindle layout since it's easy to rearrange the windows around to my fav master layout.\nHyprland also has an extension protocol for Wayland which is designed to be used with Hyprland itself.\nThis protocol was made so that it can be used with its fork of the Portal implementation for\nwlroots based compositors, known as xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland. This fork addresses the following:\n\nScreen selection - it now supports window selections now as well. This means, you can now specify\nwhich client/window you want to show on the screen.\nGlobal shortcuts - it now supports global shortcuts which is an extension of the Wayland protocol\nwhich uses Portals.\n\nI have not experienced global shortcuts in KDE Plasma on X11 before so I really do not know\nwhat to say about it. But people are hyping on it so I guess that functionality is a good thing.\nMy decision§\n\nI switched to Hyprland for the following things\n\nGood monitor support. I want to emphasize how I have trouble using wlr-randr and kanshi only\nto see an open issue on wlroots regarding mirror output support.\nDynamic tiling by default.\nPortals. The fork is great ☺️. I can finally share a specific window if I wanted to now.\n\nAdditionally, the eye-candy. I have not customized for a long time now for river. Ricing was a tedious\ntask and usually a waste of time that's why. But with Hyprland, I think that fire has somewhat lit up\nagain. Although, my current configuration for Hyprland is simple, at least I know that I can easily\nrice it up if I wanted to (round-corners look nice btw!). So yes, here is my setup with eww\nas my bar 😁\n\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/9/","title":"I switched to Hyprland"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/calling-executables-outside-distrobox-that-are-from-another-distrobox/":{"body":"Update§\n\nThis old post is outdated and requires a small update. To run an executable from another\ncontainer (here we use distrobox, a frontend for podman or docker), you just need to run\nthis command inside the desired container where you want to run the executable.\n\nMake sure that the my-executable was already distrobox-exported to the host.\nOld post§\n\nTo anyone that might have asked themselves\n\nHow do I call an executable from Y distro to the current X distro I am using in distrobox?\n\nThe answer is to create a script. But first you will have to use distrobox-host-exec. Create a symlink inside your distrobox. You can either declare\nan init-hook or do it manually. The command is\n\nThis will create a pseudo podman executable that will run the host system's podman, assuming you have that installed in your host system.\nTo check if it works, run\n\nThis will give you a list of available containers that are active.\nExample situation§\n\nSo let's assume you are in a weird situation. You want to use zig but the one on openSUSE Tumbleweed distrobox is 0.10.0 because it has an\nissue with glibc versions. But it builds correctly on openSUSE Leap 15.5! The next thing you did was to create your leap distrobox\n\nAnd then you ran the following command inside your leap distrobox\n\n\nSo uh... how do I use zig from leap when I am in a tumbleweed distrobox?\n\nBy using distrobox-host-exec which calls your podman executable! Remember the symlink? Here is the idea\npodman has an exec command. Running podman exec --help gives you the following output:\n\nSince it says here that we can run a process from a running container, we can create a script to run zig in your tumbleweed distrobox!\n\nAnd save it to /usr/local/bin/zig and run sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/zig.\nTesting your zig executable§\n\nInside your tumbleweed distrobox which now contains your pseudo zig executable, you can test if it works by doing the commands\n\nThe last command should output\n\nHow it works§\n\nWe have distrobox-host-exec (which calls host-spawn in the background), and podman. By using distrobox-host-exec to\nrun the host system podman, we can also check other running containers, not just from leap distrobox in the previous examples.\nWith podman, we can use its exec command to run executables from other containers. The important flags are\n\n-w or --workdir. This is where you set $PWD\n-i or --interactive. This allows interactivity\n-t or --tty. This will allow it to work somewhat okay-ish in a terminal.\n\nPlus $@ to add possible other subcommands of an executable e.g. build, test, --help.\nThe --user is set to $USER so it respects your user inside the container. Otherwise, it will become root which\nmaybe is not what you want.\nSo the final and cool command for the pseudo zig executable is:\n\nMore information§\n\nYou can find more information from the following links:\n\nhttps://distrobox.privatedns.org/usage/distrobox-host-exec/\nhttps://manpages.opensuse.org/Tumbleweed/podman/podman-exec.1.en.html\n\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/calling-executables-outside-distrobox-that-are-from-another-distrobox/","title":"Calling Executables Outside Distrobox That Are From Another Distrobox"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/change-of-plans-and-priorities/":{"body":"As my selection of what to learn grows, I think there will be a change of\nplans and priorities.

This\nis to prepare this vendoring alternative called\nobs-service-cargo-vendor-home-registry.\nThe project is still worked on during my free time.\n\nI have re-investigated possible solutions for confusing packaging in Rust. Currently,\nwe are using cargo vendor to vendor package dependencies. This comes at a cost.\n\nBack and forth copying of .cargo/config.toml for possible projects that use monorepo\nconfigurations i.e. workspace and real monorepos.\n\nExamples of these are: zellij, wezterm and python-tokenizers\n\n\nWe always want to ensure Cargo.lock and I doubt the solution will not avoid this\nsince lockfiles are always essential when building software with Rust.\nExisting .cargo/config.toml from projects will be overridden with our generated\n.cargo/config.toml.\n\nThe first solution I thought of is a global .cargo/config.toml for projects. This\nhas been done with python-tokenizers in openSUSE because it is possible to use\n--manifest-path to specify a manifest Cargo.toml file in the specfile for cargo\ninvocations.\nSeeing this, I realised, why not just use the $CARGO_HOME since we are pointing at a global cache anyway? This blog is about tracking my future project\nhttps://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/obs-service-cargo-vendor-home-registry of which I plan to integrate into https://github.com/Firstyear/obs-service-cargo as an alternative vendor generating utility for Open Build Service or OBS.\nStorage size eaten by CARGO_HOME vs cargo vendor comparison§\n\n\nNOTE\ncargo fetch, cargo vendor, cargo build, and cargo generate-lockfile all update the CARGO_HOME or what we call the cargo home registry or just cargo home. We use cargo fetch here because it's designed to update the registry cache instead of other commands.\nWARNING Behaviours between cargo fetch and cargo generate-lockfile\ncargo fetch updates the registry to latest version of crates and also regenerates Cargo.lock to reflect the versions unless --locked flag is passed where it tries to respect the versions of the crates from the existing Cargo.lock despite this contradicting description in the manpage that\nIf a Cargo.lock file is available, this command will ensure that all of the git dependencies and/or registry dependencies are downloaded and locally available. Subsequent Cargo commands will be able to run offline after a cargo fetch unless the lock file changes.\nHowever, cargo generate-lockfile updates the registry + updates the Cargo.lock which in my opinion is just a duplication of the other cargo sub-command cargo update. Why? Both do the same behaviour. Even the part where you pass --locked will give you the same error \"error: the lock file /run/host/tmp/jay-1.4.0/Cargo.lock needs to be updated but --locked\".\n\nHere are the zstd compressed tarballs for the following after running the cargo commands\nwezterm\n\ncargo-vendor: 1.1GB\ncargo-fetch: 1.3GB\n\njay\n\ncargo-vendor: 24MB\ncargo-fetch: 76MB\n\nzellij\n\ncargo-vendor: 66MB\ncargo-fetch: 133MB\n\nWhy does it seem like cargo-fetch duplicates the contents in the tarball? Because it really does. The registry contains the following directory structure\n\nOne can remove the .cargo/registry/src directory as that contains the extracted crates and then create a tar.zst file using the following commands\n\nHow to get cache from $CARGO_HOME§\n\nAny of these commands will generate the cargo home registry cache\n\nbuild\ngenerate-lockfile\nvendor\nfetch\nupdate\n\nSome commands are duplication of the other commands i.e. update and\ngenerate-lockfile. It's just that the former prefetches the latest crate versions\nwhile the latter doesn't.\nTo update the registry cache, one must either go with cargo fetch or even cargo vendor to avoid building or updating (unless update is set).\nAll commands try to regenerate the Cargo.lock with the latest compatible MSRV. If\n--locked is passed, it will try to attempt to respect the versions in the Cargo.lock.\nHowever, if the version of a dependency in Cargo.lock got yanked and there is a\nnewer version, then an operation with --locked will fail. Also, passing --locked to\ncargo-update is ambiguous as it will always almost fail since it tries to update the\nCargo.lock.\nWhy not go with cargo vendor --sync§\n\nReason? Uncertainty of how that command respect Cargo.lock for each crate. I would\nrather have do\n\nfor each manifest found since one can flexibly turn --locked on and off.\nBuilding now with $CARGO_HOME§\n\nIt's always has been possible to use $CARGO_HOME, specifically, $CARGO_HOME/registry.\nThere was an attempt in this repository, https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo-vendor-home-registry.\nNow, that project has been merged into https://github.com/openSUSE-Rust/obs-service-cargo.\nYou can see this working in https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/editors/kak-lsp. But we lied a bit here.\nWe will explain that in the later sections.\nPath dependencies in Cargo.toml needs to be revisited§\n\nMembered crates (in workspace configurations) and local crates (both are local and in path actually)\nshould also be taken consideration when vendoring dependencies.\nFor example, https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/science:machinelearning/python-tokenizers have\ntwo different dependencies that are actually related to each other.\nThe solution to this is to eagerly check their manifest and lockfiles. Hence, either with multiple vendor\ntarballs or a vendored $CARGO_HOME.\nLockfiles are always inconsistent§\n\nSee https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7169. This is a glaring issue\nand not just for cargo install but almost all cargo commands such as cargo fetch. That's why in openSUSE, we try to include the lockfile as much as\npossible even if passing --locked. I think I would agree to this comment\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/7169#issuecomment-539226733.\nObservation\n\ncargo fetch --locked does not work because it tries to keep the registry cache updated\ncargo vendor --locked works because I don't know why???\n\nNow is the use of --sync idea thrown out the window?\nFor crates that don't ship with a lockfile, we will run eithercargo generate-lockfile\nor cargo update, former is more semantically correct to do as opposed to cargo update. But update makes sense the most because we are going to add update options\non the new project anyway.\ncargo-fetch vs cargo-update§\n\nTwo days ago as of writing, I filed a bug report regarding inconsistencies\nbetween cargo-fetch and cargo-vendor. Link to bug report\nhttps://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/14795.\nThe inconsistency specifically is the way the two handle dependencies differently\nespecially when it comes to cargo-fetch's --target flag.\nI had high hopes that by default[1], it gets all target architectures. But I was\nmet with failed builds on not so commonly used architectures whereas vendored\ndependencies from cargo-vendor compiles. They fail because they cannot find their\ndependencies fetched from cargo-fetch.\nI will just have to wait for a feedback regarding how cargo-fetch behaves as compared\nto cargo-vendor. I believe though that both should be at least similar in almost\nall aspects.\n\n\nThis is still not a loss yet for me since most of the software I used in openSUSE\nare used by people who either use x86_64 and aarch64. I don't believe that the other\narchitectures are used commonly so I have removed support. ↩\n\n\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/exploring-efficient-ways-to-package-rust-software-in-opensuse/","title":"Exploring Efficient Ways To Package Rust Software in openSUSE"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/first-impressions-on-my-first-non-google-email-provider/":{"body":"I was planning last year that I will have to start looking for ways to avoid\nGoogle as much as possible or at least minimize my dependence on Google\nservices.

Fedora has one too, see https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines.\ncrystal\n\nCheck with zypper if osc is installed.\n\nTip: Use the cnf command to check which package osc comes from.\n\n\nRecipe§\n\nThe following subtopics explain how to package crystal software step-by-step. Adjust accordingly based on your setup.\nCreate a new package§\n\nYou can do it at https://build.opensuse.org/ but if you prefer the commandline,\nyou can do for example\n\nIn this tutorial, we will try to package BLAHAJ using the shards project and dependency manager for\nCrystal and tar.\nPackage without a dependency§\n\nWrite the specfile§\n\nUsing your preferred editor, create a file named blahaj.spec. The following prelude should be enough for the specfile:\n\n\nHow do I have shards and crystal?\n\nYou can branch packages from my home project at Open Build Service - https://build.opensuse.org/project/show/home:uncomfyhalomacro. Or even just add an repository\nimage of that project. I have shards and crystal there. The latter can also be found at https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:crystal/crystal if\nyou want that too.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we will assume that we are going to use crystal, shards, and make at your home project in Open Build Service.\nAdd the following sections: description, prep, build, install, files and changelog section.\n\nAt the root of your project package e.g. home:yourusername/blahaj, run osc service localrun download_files. You will get a file called blahaj-2.1.0.tar.gz.\nExtracting the file gets us the directory BLAHAJ-2.1.0/. This means that in our %prep section, we need to add %setup -qa1 -n BLAHAJ-%{version}. This is to\nredirect the rpm macros that building should be at RPM_BUILDDIR/BLAHAJ-2.1.0/ since by default, it is RPM_BUILDDIR/nameofpackage-version/\nbased on the Name: and Version: RPM specfile prelude.\nBuilding and Installing the package§\n\nThe following sections should be easy here since make as build dependency has convenient macros such as %make_build and %make_install.\n\nAs for %files, you can just do a \"best guess\" or \"best observation\" approach. Here, we based it from the Makefile and for documentation and license, those are\nself-explanatory.\nChangelog can be left as is since we are not Fedora 😘. We use blahaj.changes for that generated with osc vc. It creates a temporary file you can edit\nfrom like below\n\nAdd the files§\n\nAdd the files by running the command\n\nAnd then push it to your home project at Open Build Service with osc ci, which allows you to check the diff and see what was changed based from the\nblahaj.changes file.\nCheck if it builds correctly§\n\nNow check your new blahaj package at your home project. If it fails, investigate what went wrong! Check mine at\nhttps://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:uncomfyhalomacro/blahaj.\n\nNOTE:\nIt seems at the time of writing, I missed some dependencies or optional dependencies for\ncrystal! Anyway, I am confident it will build this correctly after that's fixed.\n\nPackage With dependencies§\n\nThis is where tar and shards comes in. An example of this is shards itself. See https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/home:uncomfyhalomacro/shards.\nWhat I did here is at the root of the project e.g. home:yourname/shards, I extracted the shards source tarball, tar xvf shards-0.17.3.tar.gz. Changed directory\nto the extracted directory, shards-0.17.3/ and then ran shards check and shards install. You will get a new directory called lib/. This is where you\nvendor your dependencies like how Rust and Go do.\nTo vendor it, it's simple. Just run\n\nCopy vendor.tar.zst to the root of the project package folder. Add it to one of the sources of your project and adjust your %setup with flags -qa1\nwhich a1 means extract Source1: vendor.tar.zst to the root of RPM_BUILDDIR/shards-0.17.3 including the root folder of the archive lib/.\nThis will create a new directory called lib/, and contains other crystal packages that are dependencies of that project.\nThen I just used crystal to build shards as seen from the build section and do a manual install with install command at the install section.\nOther possibilities§\n\nYou can also remove make or shards as well if you prefer just using crystal on the build section.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/how-to-package-crystal-software-in-opensuse/","title":"Packaging Crystal Software for openSUSE"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/how-to-setup-julia-with-kakoune/":{"body":"This short post talks about how I setup Julia for Kakoune based of from my\nconfig. I rarely use\nJulia nowadays but some people still ask me how to setup Julia for X and Y\neditor lmao. So I'm just going to write it here to help others out a bit.\nWhat is Kakoune?§\n\nKakoune is a modal editor that tries to\nbe better than Vim. It reverses the action-verb syntax of Vim e.g. dw for\ndelete word in Vim, wd in Kakoune.  And it also removes some inconsistencies\nof the Vim editor when it comes to other functions of which I won't discuss\nand which you have to find out yourself.\nThe editor also has multi-cursors which is a controversial topic among\nterminal editor enthusiasts. But it's a good fit for Kakoune because of its\n\"haptic\" feedback or more accurately visual feedback that shows a selection\nbefore we can do any action.\nThe editor also has some kind of session/server support where you can edit in\nthe same server socket. This allows multi-window editing without the actual\nneed of a multiplexer (although, most users do actually use a multiplexer to\nmake the experience better). Here is an example script to allow me to connect\nan existing session with sk or skim\n(an fzf clone in Rust).\n\nThe editor also has its own configuration language called kakscript. Although\nit's better for you to explore what it is since it will be discussed in\nthis post.\nThis editor is highly opinionated and has many mixed opinions among Vimmers.\nI don't consider myself a Vim expert nor a Kakoune expert but I have experienced\nusing many editors since the start of COVID-19.\nSetup§\n\nSome prerequisites needed:\n\nInstalled cargo from Rust\nKakoune itself\nJulia\n\nAssuming you already have the prerequisites, head to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak or\n~/.config/kak.  If the directory does not exist, create it with md or\nmkdir. Next, at the root of the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak\nor ~/.config/kak let's add a bootstrap install script for\nkak-bundle in the file kakrc.\n\nThe script was written in a configuration language called kakoune script\nor kakscript. The idea behind the language is to utilise the built-in shell\nthat is assumed to be POSIX-compliant or POSIX-compatible e.g.  bash, zsh,\nsh, dash, et cetera.\nInstalling Kakoune LSP§\n\nSome people including me can't live without LSP so let's include that to\nour kakrc file.\n\nWe also need to add a bootstrap script to install the LanguageServer.jl package with\nPackageCompiler.jl. At the root of the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak or ~/.config/kak, create\nthe directory scripts. Then create the file scripts/julia-ls-install with the following\ncontents\n\nAnd in the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak/kakrc or ~/.config/kak/kakrc file, append the following contents\n\nThis will allow you to install kakoune-lsp as well as Julia's LanguageServer.jl and PackageCompiler.jl.\nThe script allows you to run a precompiled sysimage of the Julia LanguageServer.jl (although it's not needed\nthat much ever since precompilation has improved since version 1.9 of Julia).\nConfiguring the LSP§\n\nkakoune-lsp also needs to have a file that configures the LSP of any language. At the root\nof the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak-lsp or ~/.config/kak-lsp, create the file kak-lsp.toml. If the\ndirectory does not exist, create it first before creating the file. Add the following\ncontents to the file\n\nThen at the root of the $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak or ~/.config/kak, add a new file scripts/julia-ls-kak\nwith the following content\n\nThis is a custom LSP script I made to avoid the limitations of just running\nrun(server). See the comments above the project_path variable.\nConclusion§\n\nThat's it.

And I decided that using helix is the\nbest way to do things.\nSo why helix?§\n\nTo be honest, helix's keymappings make more sense to me. It feels more\nintuitive to use unlike Emacs' C-x C-c and C-x C-s. I kind of understand\nnow what the \"Emacs Pinky\" means.\nHelix well designed keymaps (opinion and bias from me) gives me high efficiency\nin coding and fixing stuff.\nFor taking notes§\n\nMy note taking habits§\n\nI take notes... but not frequently. To be honest, I only take notes if I feel\nlike it's something important but my brain does not deem it so. I usually\nremember stuff easily if I condition myself that it is important.\nSo that's why I decided to use zk + helix + zellij since for me I\nusually make a todo list rather than taking notes.\nI think zk is fine.

To be honest I don't feel happy taking notes through emacs.\nFor programming§\n\nI use lsp-mode and it's so slow to be honest. This is because of emacs\nbeing single threaded and files with 300 LoC slows it down considerably when\nran on emacs.\nWith helix's native tree-sitter and LSP support, plus the amazing async\ncapabilities it has because Rust and cool devs, it feels fast and does not\nslow me down waiting for UI to pop up or to format the whole file. Helix\ncan handle more LoC with no lags and slowdowns.\nMulti-cursor and multi-selections is well supported on Helix. I don't have\nto deal with an .mc-list which for me is just a hack to avoid Emacs'\nweird behavior when doing multiple cursor / selections, for which is a hack\n(a well thought out hack) by itself to make Emacs have multi-cursors.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/i-decided-to-move-back-to-helix/","title":"I decided to move back to helix"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/i-fell-in-love-with-rust/":{"body":"For quite some time, I am getting more interested in programming\nlanguages that have good documentation, a large community and\naccelerating adoption in various sectors in the industry.\n\nRust came to mind. I just want to write this because there are some\nthings in Rust that actually make sense to me as a language. I might\nbe guilty that I have been influenced by the hype since the start\nof COVID-19, but after 3 years or so, learning the language, talking\nwith people, reading again the documentation - things have started\nto make sense and that's why I fell in love with Rust. Here\nare the whys.\nShared Behaviours§\n\nAlthough, these concepts are most likely OOP, I never really appreciated OOP\nin Python. Maybe because of lack of experience? Or interest in the language? Or\nmaybe I just hate Python.  I never said I won't be biased in this post so...\nAnyway, a shared behaviour in Rust is one of the best things that makes sense to me.\nThese are called traits, and Rust actually stole this from Java's interfaces.\nA trait will look like something like this\n\nAnd it's a very nice addition to Rust. Whoever thought of this is a genius!\nGenerics§\n\nRust's generics are one of my favourites. It allows more flexibility and\nfine-grained control. For example, there are many environments of how a\nfruit is grown, be it LaboratoryGrown, or Natural.\n\nSome concepts that took me months to understand§\n\nWho owns who?§\n\nAt first, when I was starting with Rust, I didn't understand the ownership system\nbecause I don't have experience writing in C or any language that involves pointers\nand references heavily. However, I self-studied just enough to understand these\nconcepts and it's starting to makes sense! Well to me...\nAlthough, I don't have years of experience writing in C, Rust babysits me\nteaching me about references and pointers while also protecting me from\nmistakes like using the same pointer to manipulate data, or doing stupid shit\nlike dropping data from the heap too early.\nI am resuming to learn C a few days after this to understand footguns Rust\nwants me to avoid.\nAbstractions pamper me§\n\nRust just hides away some of the abstraction from you but also shows you\nthat these elisions (thanks firstyear, new word) are not actually hidden.\nThey're just common patterns most would take so elided so that they can\nbe written a little less verbose, and a little less yuck.\nRust ecosystem§\n\nRust has like many popular crates to choose from. The community loves to\ncurate and makes it way easier to getting started with Rust even for\nsomeone like me who still considers himself not a good programmer. I still\ndo think that I am not good but I love to learn cool stuff.\nWhat actually made me fall in love with Rust§\n\nThe reason is because of Rust's syntax. I know, someone may already have\nexpected, \"oh you love Rust because it's blazingly fast!!!\", but the\nreality is, what got me hooked into Rust the first time was actually its\nverbose syntax. The first time I tried reading it, its verbosity made me\nfeel comfortable like it's not hiding anything from me. Whereas, in Python,\nI always feel uncomfortable... I am not sure why, even though I have some\nexperience with it during the Hyperskill beta test by JetBrains of which I\ncompleted at least 90% of the beta test.\nBut yeah, Rust's choice of symbols for its syntax and the feeling of \"I am\nnot hiding anything, I can tell you if you ask the right questions\" is\nthe reason I fell in love with the language.\nBTW, I also heard you like Julia§\n\nNah... can't hate what I haven't written for a while.

I sacrifice my privacy in the\nname of having connections.\nIs it bad though? Probably.\nWill I risk chance to keep in touch with\nfriends? No.\nThis is why even most of us OSS advocates are not purists and pushing us\nto become a purist means losing friends, and ease of communication between\nfamily members.\nI am not hopeful that there will be a chance to change that. And I don't\nbelieve we have the power to change what has become a necessity. Correct\nme if I am wrong. :)\nAdvocate but don't be pushy§\n\nRather than pushing non-technicals, we slowly educate. We share what we use,\nwhat we do, and answer what curiousities they have about OSS.\nPushing will only literally push them away from the possible interest they have\nabout our lives, and about OSS.\nActivityPub may have made it possible§\n\nGiven the state of social networking and the boom of\nActivityPub instances, I think\nthere is a chance we can introduce more people to OSS.\nOne good example is the controversial issue of federating with Meta's\nThreads.\nI have mix-feelings with ActivityPub instances federating with Threads\nand there are a lot of people that actually do not like to federate with\nthem[6] [7]. I actually lean more of not wanting\nto federate.\nOther content creators are more or less pro-federation of Threads because\nsome of their arguments are like these:\n\nyour posts are public, anybody can scrape your information. Fair enough\nthis allows us to increase exposure of OSS to the non-technicals. Good point but I will stay observant\nincrease exposure means making people aware and may allow them to move over to OSS. Hmm okay\n\nBut it so happens that the current Mastodon\ninstance I am in, Fosstodon, is openly federating\nwith Threads.\nHowever, this might[8] be the only way to show non-technicals\nthe existence of Open Source and its movement. Big MAYBE I guess.\nThe current state of non-technicals and us§\n\nTo be honest, there is a lot to do to shorten the gap between the technicals\nand the non-technicals. One example is our tend to gatekeep and have\nelitist-like tendencies to push curious non-technicals who are new to\nOSS. And there are a lot of norms on the technicals' side of things about\ndesktop computing e.g.  GUI vs CLI, that may cause non-technicals to never\nuse OSS alternatives at all.\nOur chance to change our behaviors and our approach is always now, the\npresent. And to do that is to sympathize and empathize with new users rather\nthan barking at them for no good reason.\nWe should raise awareness and be open to alternatives. In today's age,\nvisible presence is key to allow more adoption of OSS to non-technicals.\n\n\nhttps://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/ ↩\n\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/272698/global-market-share-held-by-mobile-operating-systems-since-2009/. ↩\n\n\nThis maybe for Google Chrome but it also applies to any company known for their shady practices.

My current plans after this\nis to start donating to Codeberg, starting July. The reason why I\ndecided to self-host is page load. My website, despite being a static website,\nis slow to load because of Codeberg Pages. Codeberg Pages is fine actually, but\nat some points in time it does a bit weird. This is probably because the data\ncenters are in Germany or somewhere in Europe while I am in the Philippines.\nThe self-hosting provider I use for here is Linode. But I plan\nto change after a month. I think I am looking at Contabo next.\nMore reasons why below.\nAbout Linode§\n\nLinode. Hmm. I can't give much opinions about it. This is my first time\ntrying out self-hosting after all.\nThe pricing is in my opinion, could be better? Not sure. Now that I found\nout about Contabo, I plan to ditch this instance and move over.\nDocumentation is actually there in Linode but most of it is either outdated\nor possibly wrong? I have a lot of things I read from the docs that did not\nwork well for me so I read official sources instead aka the documentation\nof the software I am going to use. They could have done it better I guess\nand they lack docs for openSUSE too 😢.\nI plan to have two compute instances in Contabo because I plan\nto use the other instance for a database, and also self-hosting Woodpecker\nCI. Possibly I will add other services as well such as\n\nNextCloud\nVaultWarden (Bitwarden basically) or I just use password-store.\nCollabora Office\n\nI might share one of these services to my family or friends I guess.\nThe reason being, for experience and it's also very fun.\nWhat I learned so far§\n\nExperimenting Forgejo§\n\nIt would be a waste to not use the remaining compute resources so I decided\nto give Forgejo a Go. 😉\nForgejo is available now in openSUSE. Although, I am quite confused\nby the systemd service but now I understand the implications for\nwhy it was decided not to use the home directory of whatever\ninvokes the forgejo binary. This was discussed in the\nhttps://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_Features#Systemd_hardening_effort.\nAnyhow, I had a lot of hiccups configuring Forgejo but I just\ndecided to just use whatever that systemd script has and just edit the file\nto point to a custom config by running\n\nspecifically, I edited the line containing ExecStart=.\n\nEDITOR=kak is so annoying. openSUSE does have a way\nto set this by adding that to /etc/profile.local.\nLocal configs or those that are suffixed with *.local is\nunique to openSUSE. Users are encouraged to edit the\nlocal configs rather than the defaults. This is how\nI got so confused at first when trying it out the first time.\nAlso, this explains why I also edit the apache config\nat a different file instead of the httpd.conf file. Specifically,\nby editing /etc/sysconfig/apache2 🥴.\n\nAnyway, the site is up at https://forgejo.uncomfyhalomacro.pl. Feel free\nto take a look around. However, registrations are closed so if you want\nto make an account, you are not able to unless we are friends. ⚠️\nIf you are my friend, do keep in mind that this is experimental and still\npossible that I will kill this instance. Once I get the hang of it, I will\nstart putting my projects to the self-hosted vm.\nAnother issue I have is setting the [mailer] configuration. Because it seems\nto be not working to be honest and I am not sure why. I filed a ticket to\nmy mail provider if MTA is part of their service because I might be mistaken.\nNginx§\n\nTo manage redirects and subdomain URLs, I tried my hand at Nginx. I read it\nas ngeenx and not like 'engine X' or like how I read Lynx.\nFirst Impressions§\n\nThe language looks like KDL. I actually do not know\nwhat Nginx use but whatever. The syntax confuses me a lot to be honest and\nI really don't like how it looks when configuring. Some of you might find\nthe language simple. But what really confused me a lot is doing redirects. I\nguess I didn't read enough documentation 🥴.\nCertbot Integration Impressions§\n\nCertbot integration is nice. The pressing issue is when certbot rewrites\nfiles for Nginx.  This causes a lot of confusion to me because the\nrewritten configs to point to the SSL certificates are faulty and can\ncause misredirects. I have to manually edit the files to be honest.\nApache§\n\nI am not sure why but after the onslaught of trying Nginx, I decided\nto use Apache.\nFirst Impressions§\n\nI got pampered by openSUSE because it contains templates at /etc/apache2/vhosts.d.\nAt first, I was so confused because when I read the default config at\n/etc/apache2/httpd.conf, the documentation from Linode and other sources\nconflict because openSUSE's default config has a lot of comments to discourage\nthe use of it. Instead, I have to edit /etc/sysconfig/apache2 and add a\nnew file /etc/apache2/httpd.conf.local. This file is added to /etc/sysconfig/apache2,\nspecifically, APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES. Here is a snippet of the updated sysconfig.\n\nBetter syntax, plugins, and tooling§\n\nI am not saying that I did not have difficulty using Apache. But\nas I roamed around the Internet, I just found out that it uses\nutility tools that helps installs plugins. As of writing, I have\nadded the filter and deflate module. The latter was already\nadded by default but the filter module was not. This was\nto enhance page loads (yeah I know it's a static site 🤣) but\na small speed up helps 🤪.\nIt's also easy to just add additional subdomains as well\nin /etc/apache2/vhosts.d. You just have to configure if what you want\nis a reverse proxy and a redirect or serve directly the directory\nspecifically those in /srv/www/vhosts.\nCertbot Integration Impressions§\n\nI am just going to say that the integration with certbot is amazing.  Even as\nto correctly configure my configs. Running certbot --apache -d mydomain.com -d other.mydomain.com is a breeze. It will add a new file corresponding\nto the config name with -le-ssl.conf suffix. I just add a small modification\nbut so far only to the one that contains www.mydomain.com.\nDNS§\n\nIn regards to DNS, I have some issues configuring it. I manage to learn more\nabout A/AAAA and CNAME records. So far, it's all good and working.\nI am just surprised that I don't know how long it will really propagate. One\nhiccup I made before was a mistypo of configuring spam reputation for\na mail provider I use for my custom domain. And yes, it did propagate\nthe domain and because of that, I have or had an ephemeral URL domain\nautoconfig.mydomain.com which points to my atuin instance. It's gone now.\nClosing Thoughts§\n\nSelf-hosting is a fun idea. Although, I might be looking at other hosting solutions\nlike Contabo. I heard they have a good price over ratio but I also\nheard mixed reviews from different communities e.g. they lower the quality\nof network bandwidth (?) but I can't seem to see what's the issue yet\nso I might have to experience that myself.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/self-hosting-is-fun-but/","title":"Self hosting is fun but..."},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/sustainable-development-is-unsustainable/":{"body":"How come that the most sought after solution to our problems in sustainability\nis actually NOT REAL?\n\nThere are many factors that contributed towards this misconception that sustainable development\nis possible. TLDR; it is not.\nThese kind of factors are intentional to force a phenomenon called \"greenwashing\". Governments, oil companies,\nand other NGOs that are paid to educate, spread this misinformation about sustainability and provide\nbogus researches about sustainable development.\nWhy is sustainable development impossible?§\n\nThink about it, every time a pair of reproductively-capable human beings procreate, a new human being in need\nof nourishment is added in the population. To get this nourishment, providers such as farmers, fishermen, and\nother food producers are forced to \"scalp\" more natural habitats to gain space for food production.\nHowever, sustainable development defenders (let us call them SDDs from now on), show us some graphs, specifically,\na logarithmic trend of a graph and population that says that to achieve sustainability, the graph should\nstart to flatline at some hypothetical asymptote (maximum). Unfortunately, this fails to see population growth is\nalways exponential. Even if that graph shows a near flatline, converting that graph to a\nlinear graph will show that food consumption, habitat destruction, and human population is\nalways on the rise. Why is it that we fail to see this?\nBecause people do not know how to read graphs. Even so-called experts fail to interpret them.\nReduce Reuse Recycle. A Myth.§\n\nSince you were zero years old and your parents where still small children, they have been taught the triple Rs,\nfamously known as Reduce Reuse Recycle. The rationale is to lessen the impacts of trash taking up space in the\nenvironment. Well, this is what the SDDs taught you and your parents and your parents' parents.\nUnfortunately, all about this reduce, reuse, and recycle, it depends if we have any facilities at all to\ncommit to lessening the impacts of trash. Even developed countries throw their trash to developing countries,\nalbeit, discreetly and hidden from the media.\n\nlooks at Canada throwing trash to the Philippines\n\nUntil then, as population grows, trash on both land and water, also grow exponentially.\nPaper Bag and plastic bag rotation§\n\nThis one is funny because it does not really solve the problem. Producing paper requires a lot of energy, harmful\nchemicals, and lots of trees if recycled paper is not viable. And the waste product is chemicals, and more greenhouse\ngases in the form of water vapor and carbon dioxide. Plastic requires lots of energy to produce too.\nSDDs push this notion that we should rotate usage of both plastic bags and paper bags on some days and on other days.\nAgain, it is bogus, it does not really solve the current problem of trash. Growing population always equates to\ngrowing production of these materials.\nSegregation of trash. A matter of etiquette.§\n\nSomewhat related to Reduce Reuse Recycle, SDDs taught people that we should\nsegregate trash. In example, biodegradable and non-biodegradable. But this is more of a matter of etiquette.\nI agree you should segregate your trash but the growing notion that it helps solve the problem with landfills\nand ocean trash is actually false. We cannot keep up on reducing trash as population grows. Etiquette does not\nsolve the trash problem.\nFood prices are rising and that makes sense§\n\nThis is because there are more mouths to feed and more space to acquire. This is another proof that sustainability\nis false and it is pretty clear that this trend will continue.\nWhere is the citation?§\n\nDo I need to? It's hard to keep up putting references but it's pretty clear that COP28 is a failure 🙄\nConclusion§\n\nSustainable Development is a myth.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/sustainable-development-is-unsustainable/","title":"Opinion: Sustainable development is unsustainable"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/technology-is-the-cause-of-all-brain-drain/":{"body":"I haven't finished reading Amusing ourselves to\ndeath.\nBut it is kind of obvious that the result of technology's effects on youth\nand how tech companies pursue this abuse of cocktail concoction of digital\naddiction are \"zombification\" of people today.\n\nDigital addiction is not new. It's a global problem. Educational institutions\naround the world are finding solutions to mitigate this effect.\nTechnology is not the problem. Content is.§\n\nDigital addiction is sometimes attributed to technology. But it is wrong\nto blame technology. Intent on use and/or abuse is the issue here.\nCompanies take advantage of the psychological patterns humans have. Our\naddiction to momentary pleasures is one thing. And they take it to the\nnext level — social media.\nSocial media§\n\nSocial media is not new. Its cousin, social networking, is an old thing. IRC\nchats exist, Myspace, whatever you call it. Those olden days where people\njust love to chat and talk with their friends from far away are now gone.\nSo why do we focus on the fact that \"Social media\" is different? It is because\nof the content it has and how it affects human behavior. It also changed\nhow we perceive ourselves towards other people and thus, \"stories\" and\n\"post random things every minute\".\nRepetitive§\n\nBecause of this, social media has taken away our freedom of \"time\". We are so\nhooked with the idea to get the taste of attention that it ended up making\npeople as mediocre as they are and as braindead as can be.\nTiktok for example forces women (or men) to become thirst traps. Tiktok\nforces people to indulged in short videos that do weird crap dances that\ndon't make sense and don't contribute to anything to society. This is\nnot just in Tiktok but also on other platforms.\nOur reliance of technology is kind of understandable. Our ancestors depend on\nthese things for survival. That purpose has lost its meaning in the modern age.\nAnd it is mostly for that large dose of dopamine.\nBoring and brain draining§\n\nSocial media brings boring and brain draining people into the space. As\npeople flock over to get others attention, most people are focused on the\n\"getting attention\" part rather than the \"get a life\" part.\nTechnology is not the problem. Capitalism is.§\n\nOur world has focused to get more money faster and exploit more people to\nbecome their advertisers. This so called \"influencers\" are the issues.\nInfluencers§\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\nI am not declaring that all \"influencers\" are bad. There are good\nones such as those that educate about science, cosmetics, and technology.\nI am referring to those that do not bring value but to get quick money from\nproducts that are questionable and sometimes even dangerous, not just\nphysically, but mentally as well.\n\n\nThese influencers also bring false positivity into the space that blinds\npeoples' critical thinking. There are also who promote poverty-porn to gain\nmore attention but behind the scenes, they are as \"matapobre\" as they can be.\nFree is not free§\n\nAs explained before on my other\npost,\ncompanies trick people that free is actually free. It's not. You are the\nproduct. Most people do not care anyway so why bother explaining. Right?\nBut despite knowing this, people are conditioned to believe that they need\nthese things. So they are more likely to stay.\nPost rant§\n\nTo be honest, this is such a huge topic that a post is too small\nto cover all the issues and causes of digital addiction. And there\nare a lot of articles already about this topic. But do people really\ncare? Not really. Big maybe.\nFQA§\n\n\n\n\"We can solve the addiction by providing educational shorts!\". To be honest,\nthat's just adding more to the problem. If the platform is still riddled with\ndistracting content, then what is the point? Educational shorts don't bring\nmuch value in the end anyway since they are easily forgotten.\n\n\n\"We can solve digital addiction by confiscating smartphones during class hours\".\nThe issue isn't about the use of smartphones in the classroom. It's outside.\n\n\n\"We should remove technology\". No, you just missed the point.\n\n\n\"AI and large language models will solve our brain drain\".

It is more likely that people will\nuse these things to complete their seemingly \"scientific\" articles as described\nby the article mentioned:\n\nUnfortunately, the problem of citation manipulation is likely to exacerbate\nin the age of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI).

To still be relevant, the\npace of publishing new articles should stay consistent. It's not necessarily\na bad thing.\nBut there is this perverted gamified tradition that one must have at least\npublished as many as they can within a year just to stay relevant.\nMy overall opinion§\n\nThis does not entirely happen in the science community.

For now, expect that I will mostly focus\non updating packages related to Rust, Wayland, and Julia. I hope there are contributors out there who\ncan fill that time gap if anything important arises. Anyone who are willing enough can check out\nthe wiki for packaging documentation.\nImproving my knowledge of Wayland§\n\nMy knowledge of Wayland was postponed on 2023. I was planning to learn but personal time (mostly laziness)\ntook most of the chances to learn Wayland (and other stuff). My plan for next year is learn how to write\na Wayland client with the help of my friends on Waycrate. I felt sorry\nfor Aakash doing all the work and maintenance. I am glad that there are people that like to contribute at\nleast. Thanks Andreas and shootingstardragon.\nImproving my knowledge on Julia§\n\nJulia. Oh yeah I forgot. This language was supposed to be my favorite language until I became a Rust fanboi.\nMost of my knowledge on Julia is back to zero. I literally don't know anything now\nabout the language so it seems. I am planning to refresh next year by writing a pure Julia package for the\nRDF specification, a W3C standard for graph data. This is quite\nrelated to a postponed package for SBOL3.jl. Although, writing that package after finishing for RDF package\nin Julia is mutually exclusive.

I plan to share them to the private\nuniversity I work for by raising awareness about costs and advantages of using OSS.\nProbably leaving OSSPH once 2024 ends§\n\nI am planning to leave OSSPH or specifically step down. Not too sure why\n(it's probably cryptocurrency and Web3). I feel like the community have little impact to what I do in my life\nso I guess it's time to plan that ahead unless anything changes.\nNon-tech and non-academic related plans§\n\nI plan to get regular workouts next year even just light exercises. I am gaining weight slowly and it's kind of sad\nthat my plan to maintain around 64 kilograms is now nearing 72 kilograms.\nI also plan to mitigate my procrastination. It's hard. And it caused a lot of woes this year. I don't know why\nI procrastinate but I have a feeling it's due to my subconscious telling me \"what you're doing is not worth it\".\nI would like to know why but I think I have an answer. It's time to tire myself out positively 🫡.\nI also plan to increase my reach from various parts of communities be it tech or biology so I hope 2024 is a blast.\nSo uh...§\n\nYes. By January, I will postpone all programming activities and software maintenance unless someone emails me\nthat a package needs to be updated. I will resume such activities starting February.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/what-to-look-forward-for-on-2024/","title":"What to look forward on 2024"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/why-ph-institutions-should-use-foss/":{"body":"Background§\n\nFor a very long time, the Philippines is no stranger for the problems of\nscience and tech illiteracy, especially when it comes to the usage of their\nown computers. From controversial topics such as privacy and security,\nand also from the ethical and moral perspectives of using software such as\npiracy and scams.\nMost Filipinos do not even know the term \"Open Source\" nor any software that\nare actually Free and Open Source Software.\nHence, I am advocating the idea of raising awareness of Free and Open Source\nSoftware or FOSS so multiple institutions in the country would reconsider\nusing FOSS alternatives over proprietary ones. With this, I hope that we\nlearn its importance and how it will shape our lives for the better.\nSo what is Open Source Software (OSS)?§\n\nBasically, open source is a philosophy. It is a belief that open code\ncollaboration is vital for the improvement and innovation of technology and\nsoftware. Open means, the code is accessible by or for everyone. Think of it\nas a humanitarian mission to improve the livelihood of many people,\nnot just developers, in many areas such as education, and research.\nSo what is \"Free\"?§\n\nSo there is also another philosophy in the tech space called FOSS or\nFree and Open Source Software. It is a belief that everything in\nsoftware should be free and free as in free beer and it should be\naccessible for everyone (therefore, freedom). However, please do note that\nFOSS and OSS should compensated for the free time they used for creating wonderful\nsoftware. You can help by donating to them and helping out their issues,\nnot just technically, but socially and emotionally as well.\nAfter this, what we refer as \"Open Source Software\" will either mean FOSS or OSS.\n\"There is X proprietary software, why use some free software?\"§\n\nThere is nothing wrong in using proprietary software. It always comes down\nto tolerance—what you can allow and what you cannot allow. These\nkind of \"tolerances\" can be in terms of \"security\", \"trust\", and \"privacy\"\nor whatever you can come up with.\nHowever, proprietary software is usually a blackbox, which means that\nyou really cannot check the source if there is something malicious going\non unlike Open Source Software. This is partially true though because\nOSS can still end up being malicious, it's just more transparent.\nThere are many reasons Philippines should use OSS over proprietary. These usually\ncomes from some of the following factors:\n\nFinances\nTransparency\nPrivacy\n\nThere are many others but we will focus on these for now.\nFinances§\n\nPhilippines is a poverty-stricken country (or corrupt-stricken?) and buying\nproprietary software will cost you a lot of your salary. Because of the\nculture that people should use proprietary software such productivity suites,\nFilipinos are forced to find \"cracked\" or \"hacked\" forms of these proprietary\nsoftware for \"free\" usage ending up getting malicious programs without their\nknowledge in the process such as viruses and trojans, lessening the lifespan\nof their machines or even losing their files and data.\nTo avoid that, Filipinos should install OSS alternatives for productivity.\n\nLibreoffice for office suites.\nJoplin for note taking.\nJitsi for video conferences and meetings.\nThunderbird Mail for local mail client on the desktop.\nSignal for E2E private messaging.\n\nEducational Institutions Benefit More§\n\nThe Department of Education, and the Commission on Higher Education can\nencourage the usage of OSS. By using OSS, they can focus more of their finances\non infrastructure rather than buying proprietary software subscriptions.\nFilipino students do not actually need to pay when they just want to write\ndocuments and create presentations. I mean, if they have the money, they can\nstill buy and use proprietary alternatives. But using OSS empowers students\nto finish school and use OSS confidently without having issues of money\nand finances, especially those that do not have the means to pay.\nTransparency§\n\nOpen source is more transparent. Institutions can have a look at the\nsource of the software and see what is going to be removed or added in the\nfuture or if there were new leadership or maintainers of said software. They\nare also encouraged to donate because they rely on OSS.\nThis transparency equates to increased trust of using software and allow\nFilipinos to use the software with the necessary trust they can offer to\nthat software.\nPrivacy§\n\nBecause of the introduction of OSS to the masses, curiousity for why this\nsoftware exists will allow Filipinos to define their privacy choices of\ntheir usage of software.\nThere are many privacy-oriented alternatives against unethical data collection\nof popular software such as Zoom, and Instagram. With the presence of OSS software\nwhich promotes freedom and frowns on such practices, people are more likely\nto have more understanding what privacy is, and how important it is\nto respect someone's privacy.\nAre there things you would like to add to this post?§\n\nIf you have more to add, please email me at uncomfy@uncomfyhalomacro.pl.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/why-ph-institutions-should-use-foss/","title":"Why Philippine Institutions Should Use FOSS"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/":{"body":"","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/","title":"lecture notes for various topics and fields"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/introduction-to-environmental-science/":{"body":"Definition§\n\nEnvironmental Science is an interdisciplinary field that tackles the importance of the environment\nsuch as forests and marine ecosystems and addressing issues and societal problems that harms the future\nof our biosphere.\nBut before we tackle the subject, let us understand first what is an ecosystem.\nEcosystems and habitats§\n\nThese two terms are interchangeable; habitats refer to different levels composition of functional units of\nvarious organisms and abiotic components such as humidity, and may be terrestrial or aquatic. Ecosystems,\nhowever, can encompass from the microscopic level to the entirety of the biosphere. A habitat is, therefore,\njust another name for a small part of an ecosystem.\n\nTo understand what this means, the whole planet can be considered an ecosystem as a whole. A pile of rotten\nlogs is also an ecosystem. Habitats are just subjective terms to identify various differences in geographical components\njust like how we name things in general.\n\nComponents of an ecosystem§\n\nAn ecosystem is composed of two major parts: Abiotic Components and Biotic Components. These components interact with\neach other with varying results. The goal is to achieve a more stable system through trial and error.\nEcosystems work in a way that each component has a role. The environment forces these components with assigned\nroles usually in a form of evolutionary features in biotic components and physical barriers e.g. cliffs and rivers.\n\n\nBiotic components are organisms or life such as mosquitoes and humans.\n\n\nAbiotic components are geological features and components in an ecosystem e.g. minerals and water.\n\n\nEnergy Flow in the ecosystem§\n\nEnergy is the whole driving force for everything that is happening in or on the planet. Life requires energy to do various functions\nwhere the end goal is to reproduce and to sustain a stable population.\nSimplified models of how energy flows in the ecosystem are presented as energy pyramids, food/energy chain, and the food web.\nAll of these models contain the same or similar components in the following:\n\nProducers; where composed of autotrophic organisms such as plants.\nConsumers; where these can be further broken down as\n\nPrimary consumers\nSecondary consumers\nTertiary consumers\n\n\nDecomposers; mostly comprised of microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria which breakdown dead matter into simpler compounds.\n\nThe model explains in a manner where energy flows from high density to low density.\nFlaws of these models§\n\nUnfortunately, these models do not really explain much of how the ecosystems actually work. For example, where can we assign\norganisms that generate energy from inorganic sources such as sulfur and methane and not directly from the Sun? These models\nfail to actually account for anything beyond photosynthesis, herbivory, carnivory, and omnivory.\nBiodiversity§\n\nAs the words literally means \"life in variety\" or \"life in diversity\", biodiversity refers to the level of desirable variety\nof organisms living in an area. These areas can be any habitat from forest ecosystems to a small pond. Before we can see the importance\nof biodiversity, let's understand first what is an ecological niche or niche.\nEcological Niche§\n\nYou should read the whole article that describes niches in National Geographic's Niche encyclopedic entry,\n\nA species' niche is all of the environment factors and interspecies\nrelationships that influence the species.\n\nSpecies are assigned from their environment for what roles they have. These assignments are either specialists\nand generalists; the former is a result of narrow and limited niches and the latter is a result of broader niches.\n\nNo two species can have the same exact same niche.\n\nOtherwise, one species may outcompete over the other for resources and space and may lead the other to extinction or moving\nto another area where competition is less.\nIn a sense, each species have designated roles in their habitat because of environmental factors. These designated roles\ndecides the fate of different species in that ecosystem. A loss of a species may cause an imbalance of roles and cause\na resources shift because of lack of competition or the increase thereof.\nThree levels of biodiversity§\n\nThere are three levels of biodiversity which focuses on specific aspects as per their names\nGenetic Diversity§\n\nGenetic diversity pertains to the high variation of the gene pool of a population.\nGenetic diversity is important because this variability lessens the likelihood of a population\nto be all affected by environmental factors such as disease.\nSpecies Diversity§\n\nSpecies diversity is the number of different species in a community or an ecosystem. It may also mean for another term\ncalled species richness.\nEcosystem diversity§\n\nEcosystem diversity deals with the variation of the components, both abiotic and biotic, in an ecosystem. It addresses the\ncombined characteristics of biodiversity and geodiversity.\nNiches and Biodiversity§\n\nAccording to Levine and HilleRisLambers (2009),\n\nNiches are important in maintaining species diversity\n\nAnd this may hold true for most since an increase species diversity may also mean that there is a high chance roles are specialized\nfor the species of that ecosystem. Niches are dynamic and they are assigned to the species because of environmental pressures\nand evolutionary pressures. If there are two or more species having similar roles, there is a high chance of increased competition\nwhich either eliminates the species in that space, either as extinction or migrating to other ecosystems for lesser competition.\nOfftopic: The Scientific Method§\n\nWhat is the scientific method?\nThe scientific method is a systematic process of getting the answer or closest answer to a phenomenon or a problem. It starts with\n\nObservation, it does not necessarily mean you should actually observe. Sometimes it happens in front of you and then you do a;\nHypothesis, where which you form a statement or an \"educated guess\" using existing facts and information you gathered to create the possible closest explanation to a phenomena and then do an;\nExperimentation, where which you formulate a method that is reproducible and applies your hypothesis to answer your question. Finally you will reach the;\nConclusion. However, the conclusion may not give you the exact answer to your question or you may have used the wrong methodology. Sometimes, it gives you more questions than answers.\n\nReview Questions§\n\n\nWhat is an ecosystem?\nWhat are examples of an ecosystem?\nWhat are its components? How do they interact with each other?\nEcosystems are not static/stagnant. Why is this so?\nWhy are ecosystems important?\nWhat is biodiversity? How is biodiversity related to ecosystems?\nHow can biodiversity an indicator of a healthy ecosystem?\nWhat are threats to an ecosystem?\nWhat are invasive species? Why is an introduction of a species not native to its habitat can be a disaster?\nWhy is the circulation of nutrients in an ecosystem important?\n\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/introduction-to-environmental-science/","title":"Introduction to Environmental Science"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/":{"body":"Epidemiology§\n\nIt is the study of disease dynamics. Epidemiology covers the topic of epidemics and pandemics, immunization,\nand spillovers (an event where pathogen's host jump over one species to another).\nIt may be defined as the study of distribution of health and disease in groups of people as\ndescribed by \"Biostatistics and Epidemiology\" from Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller and Jordan Smoller.\nDefinition of Disease§\n\nA disease are actually a combination of two words: dis, and ease. This means that a disease in its\ntrue meaning is discomfort or the feeling of uneasiness.\nDiseases exist because of many factors. This may include body's health in terms of nutrient intake, or the existence\nof pathogens that wreak havoc within their host's body. A disease may be obesity, a physical condition, or\npneumonia, an infection.\nIn epidemiology, understanding the \"what\", the \"why\", and the \"how\" in diseases is helpful in health care planning,\nemergence of patterns, formation of hypothesis, and formulation standards in medical practice.\nMortality and Morbidity§\n\nThese two terms are sometimes confused with each other. But in epidemiology, there are some differences.\n\nMortality is about the incidence. Incidence is the number of new cases at a specific period of time. Whereas,\nmorbidity is expressed as incidence or prevalence. Prevalence is the number of existing cases over a specific\nperiod of time, and thay may also include new cases as well.\n\nSo if someone talks about mortality rate, they are talking about incidence.\nIn reality, doing a survey or consensus for disease prevalence is easier because you will just need a sample of a population\nfor counting the cases of disease on that specific period of time. Incidence is hard because you will have to observe\na sample of healthy individuals until they manifest the disease.\nEpidemic, Pandemic, and Endemic§\n\nAn epidemic is a significant number of cases of a disease over a localized area in a period of time. A pandemic is just an\nepidemic but all over the globe. An endemic happens all over the world as well. There is a difference though. Both\npandemic and epidemic threatens the health of many people and the chance to recover from that disease or may even cause\nsignificant amount of deaths. Whereas, an endemic disease can happen over a lifetime with predictable number\nof infections. An endemic disease may evolve further into either an epidemic or a pandemic depending on the evolution\nof the pathogen that causes the disease.\n\nInfectious Diseases§\n\nDiseases caused by organisms such as bacteria, parasites, and viruses are called infectious diseases or communicable diseases.\nThese disease-causing organisms are also called pathogens. Our body has an internal environment suitable for\nmicrobial growth, thereby, making us prime targets for infectious diseases.\nPathogens or Infectious Agents§\n\nA pathogen is a disease-causing organism. Its goal is to invade, multiply, and overwhelm their host. The host may experience\nphysiological, behavioral, and even genetic changes which may lead to evident outside change or effects called symptoms. Some\npathogens do not exhibit symptoms for their hosts are so called asymptomatic. Pathogen types are of the following:\n\nBacteria\nFungi\nParasites\nViruses\n\nBacteria§\n\nBacteria (singular: bacterium) are microscopic pathogens that reproduce rapidly after entering the host.\nBacteria are usually harmless but when they multiply inside the body, they produce toxins that can cause\nillness. Not all bacteria are pathogenic. Some are essential within the human body such as Lactobacillus\nreuteri and even Eschirichia coli.\nFungi§\n\nFungal infections and diseases usually happen when the host's immune system is weakened e.g\nimmuno-supressed, immuno-compromised.\nDisease results when fungi accidentally penetrate host barriers or when immunologic defects or other\ndebilitating conditions exist that favor fungal entry and growth.\nParasites§\n\nA parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of\nits host. There are three main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: protozoa, helminths,\nand ectoparasites. The first two are considered to be endoparasites as they live inside their hosts.\nEctoparasites live outside their hosts. Tapeworms are endoparasites; mosquitoes and fleas are\nectoparasites.\nViruses§\n\nA virus is an infectious particle that multiples only inside their host's cells. They are contagious and\ncan spread fast. Viruses themselves are not alive in a sense since they do not contain the necessary\nmachinery and characteristic for which we define life as \"alive\". The COVID-19 pandemic is caused\nby a coronavirus called as SARS-CoV-2.\nMode of Transmission§\n\nThere are many ways of how disease spreads.\n\nDirect Contact. Pathogens spread through direct contact from an infected host e.g. kissing, sexual\nintercourse, coughing (as droplet transmission).\nIndirect Contact.\n\nFomites. Pathogens that live longer on surfaces can still infect new susceptible hosts e.g.\ndoor knobs, garbage cans, smartphone screens\nVectors. Some pathogens live inside other organisms that target their hosts as well e.g. mosquitoes\n, ticks and mites.\nAirborne/Aerosol transmission. Some infectious agents stay in the air (as aerosols) for long periods of time to infect new hosts.\n\n\n\n\nDisease Vectors§\n\nA disease vector or just vector is an organism that spreads disease by infecting the\nhost organism as a parasite or spreading the pathogen through physical contact by picking up\nsmall infectious agents.\nDiseases transmitted by vectors are called vector-borne diseases. Many of these vector-borne disease\nare zoonotic diseases which are diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between\nanimals and humans.\nVectors are classified based on how they spread disease. In reality, some of these modes of transmission\nare in combination, and not just one mode. For instance, a biological vector may\nalso spread the disease just through physical contact which is what a\nmechanical vector would do. There is a distinction but they are not really\nset in stone.\nThe problem with vector-borne diseases is that their transmission modes can spread through vast\ndistances. Even humans can be considered vectors as was seen on how COVID-19 spread with our existing\ntechnological marvels for travel e.g. aviation, seafaring, land vehicles.\nBiological Vectors§\n\nBiological vectors are organisms carrying pathogens within their bodies where these pathogens reside\nand multiply. Mosquitoes, ticks and mammals infected with rabies are examples of biological vectors.\nMechanical Vectors§\n\nThese are vectors that spread disease through physical contact. Flies may spread infectious agents from\ntheir surroundings to unsuspecting hosts by salivating on food, shedding skin or touching the host.\nPortals of Entry and Exit§\n\nThe portal of entry refers to the manner in which a pathogen enters a susceptible host. The portal of entry\nmust provide access to tissues in which the pathogen can multiply or a toxin can act. Often, infectious\nagents use the same portal to enter a new host that they used to exit the source host.\n\nHost-Pathogen Cycle§\n\nThis cycle is a simplified description of how pathogens infect their host.\nTransmission§\n\nPathogens can be transmitted from person to person through various routes, such as direct contact (touching, kissing, sexual contact),\nindirect contact (contaminated objects, water, food), or airborne transmission (through respiratory droplets).\nColonization§\n\nOnce a pathogen enters the host's body, it must attach to and colonize the host's tissues. Some pathogens can survive in the host's environment\nwithout causing disease, while others require specific conditions to colonize.\nInvasion§\n\nAfter colonization, the pathogen can invade host cells and tissues, causing damage and triggering an immune response. Pathogens may produce toxins\nthat damage host tissues and organs or cause inflammation, leading to symptoms such as fever, pain, and swelling.\nReplication§\n\nPathogens can replicate inside host cells, producing more infectious particles that can spread to other parts of the body or be transmitted to other individuals. The host's immune system responds to the pathogen by producing antibodies and other immune\ncells to fight off the infection. The pathogen may evolve to evade the host's immune defenses, leading to chronic infections or recurring episodes of disease.\nThe Pathogen-Disease Progression§\n\nThis section explains what a pathogen does once it infects the host.\nIncubation stage§\n\nDuring this stage, the pathogen enters the host's body and begins to multiply. The host does not yet show any signs or symptoms\nof the disease. The length of the incubation period can vary depending on the type of pathogen and the host's immune system\nProdromal stage§\n\nDuring this stage, the host begins to experience mild symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, or fever. These symptoms are not yet\nspecific to the disease, but they may indicate that the host's immune system is starting to respond to the pathogen\nAcute stage§\n\nDuring this stage, the disease reaches its full intensity and the host experiences the characteristic symptoms of the disease.\nThe pathogen has replicated and spread throughout the host's body, causing damage to tissues and organs. This is the stage when\nthe disease is most contagious and can spread to other individuals\nConvalescent stage§\n\nDuring this stage, the host begins to recover from the disease. Symptoms gradually disappear, and the host's immune system fights\noff the remaining pathogen. In some cases, the pathogen may remain dormant in the host's body and cause a relapse of the disease at a later time.\nSome Factors that Increase Chances of Disease Spread§\n\nOutside factors have an important role in increasing the chances of disease spread. These include the\nenvironment such as a hospital setting, or societal problems such as overpopulation. Here are the\nmajor factors that increase chances of disease spread.\nAntimicrobial Resistance§\n\nThe dependence on antimicrobial drugs have increased drastically within a span of five decades since the\ninception of penecillin. This is a growing problem because microorganisms can adapt faster to these\ndrugs and become resistant to it. The concern for superbugs emerging from this day and age is a\nthreat to medical care and drug manufacturers.\nMitigations exist by focusing on improving the host's immune system's response to infections rather than\nattacking pathogens through chemical warfare. Soaps and other productsfor various purposes are now required\nto not put antimicrobial components into their products as they may increase the chances of emerging\nantimicrobial resistant microorganisms.\nOverpopulation§\n\nAs the human population around the world is growing at an exponential pace, the chances of infecting\nthousands and millions of individuals from various pathogens have increased as well. Not only that,\nbut some pathogens have more time to evolve within subsets of populations and may become a threat\nin the future.\nHabitat Destruction§\n\nAs we keep on destroying the environment for more space, we are stepping closer to unknown diseases that\nwhere never known to infect humans.\nClimate Change§\n\nSame as above, but happens globally. Climate change introduces changes as well on new vectors of diseases\nthat are normally seen in the wild. As we invade more and more and change the global biosphere, we are\nin for ourselves for a questionable future in health and emerging diseases.\n\nReview§\n\n\nCite an example for why it's important to remove antimicrobial components on skin products.\nSome bacteria are normally non-pathogenic. Explain how some of these bacteria become pathogenic\nthrough horizontal gene transfer.\nHow do diseases spread? Cite an example for each mode of transmission.\nWhat is the study of disease dynamics?\nWhy are vaccinations important?

Pathogens can be anything from a virus, to a bacterium, and even\na multicellular parasite including cancer cells.\nLayered Immunity§\n\nThere are two subsystems of the immune system:\n\ninnate immune system\nadaptive immune system\n\nThese subsystems provide a layer of defenses against pathogens that keep our body\nlessen the chances of infection or further damage if otherwise.\nCells involved in the immune system§\n\nThe cells involved in the immune system are called leukocytes or \"white blood cells\".\nSome of these cells are developed in the bone marrow, whereas others are further developed in\nthe lymphatic system, hence, a subset of leukocytes are called lymphocytes. To destroy pathogens,\nleukocytes perform phagocytosis, thereby calling some of them as phagocytes.\nInnate Immune System§\n\nThe innate immune system usually begins with the physical barriers that prevents\npathogens from entering the body. These includes our own skin barrier, mucus\nmembranes and the acidity of the stomach. Cells involved in the innate immune system\nare of the following:\n\nEosinophil\nBasophil\nNeutrophil\nMonocyte\nMast Cell\nMacrophage\nDendritic Cell\nNatural killer cells\n\nThis link contains descriptions for each of these cells.\nInflammation and Fever§\n\nInflammation is the part of the response of the immune system, also called inflammatory response. The purpose of this is\nto increase blood flow to the damaged site through vasodilation. Inflammation\nis triggered by either of the two substances: histamine, and cytokine. These substances\nare released by the phagocytic cells.\nFever is the most misunderstood immune response. But it is believed that a body temperature that is higher than normal discourages pathogen reproduction.\nA normal temperature can vary from person to person, but it is usually around 98.6 °F (37 °C). A fever is not a disease. It is usually a sign that your body is trying to fight an illness or infection.\nInfections cause most fevers. You get a fever because your body is trying to kill the virus or bacteria that caused the infection. Most of those bacteria and viruses do well when your body is at your normal temperature. But if\nyou have a fever, it is harder for them to survive. Fever also activates your body's immune system.\nAdaptive Immune System§\n\nThe adaptive immune system specializes on stopping or killing pathogens using specific\nmethods of attack. The difference between innate and adaptive immunity is the fact that\nthe latter is specific. This means that the cells involved for this pathogen differs\nfor another pathogen. Cells involved in adaptive immunity are many but these are\nthe most notable in literature: B cells and T cells (both are lymphocytes).\nB Lymphocyte§\n\nB lymphocytes are cells in the adaptive immune system that specializes in\nthe production of antibodies. Antibodies is a chemical substance (usually Y-shaped in structure)\nthat acts as a \"plug\" or \"missile\" to kill or stop a pathogen in its tracks e.g. stopping\nmetabolic functions or perforation of the pathogen's outer membrane.\nT Lymphocyte§\n\nT lymphocytes are cells in the adaptive immune system that are specialized to kill\na specific pathogen. Each T lymphocyte are unique from each other and finding the right\nT lymphocyte may take longer during the symptomatic phase of the infection. While these\ncells also kill and engulf pathogens, they also revive macrophages and natural killer cells\nto kill pathogens again.\n\"Memory\" Cells§\n\nAfter the immune system finally finishes off the last remaining invader, the remnant T and B cells\nbecome \"memory\" cells. \"Memory\" cells are so called because they are used to \"remember\"\nwhat to do when such a pathogen that was encountered before invades again. This reduces the risk\nof damage and prevents most reinfections of which we all know as immunity or acquired immunity.\nOther purpose of the immune system§\n\nThe immune system has another role to prevent bodily damage. This one is to prevent\nour own cells to become tumors or cancer cells or kill them before they overwhelm our body.\nThis is what we call as immune surveillance.\nSelf and Non-Self§\n\nThe body has the ability to identify which cells are \"self\" and which are \"non-self\". In biological and medical\nterms, cells use antigens to identify \"self\" and \"non-self\". Antigens are chemical markers on a cell's surface e.g.\npathogens. Our immune system use these chemical markers to detect foreign cells in the body and destroy them.\nAllergies§\n\nSometimes our body overexaggerates immune responses.

Some\nof them discovered new drugs because of messy accidents, and others are purely\nto improve food security.\nRobert Hooke§\n\nRobert Hooke is well-renowned for his book \"Micrographia\", a collection of his explorations\nand illustrations of microbes and small organisms under his microscope. His discovery from\nhis microscope forced the realization of the existence of structures that were too small\nto be seen by the unaided eye.\nAntoni van Leeuwenhoek§\n\nAlso known as the \"Father of Microbiology\", Antoni van Leeuwenhoek was probably first to\nobserve microorganisms under the microscope of which he called animalcules. He published\nhis works to the Royal Society in London.\nLouis Pasteur§\n\nIn the 1850s, Louis Pasteur is a chemist and a microbiologist known\nfor his works and studies about fermentation. He discovered th at wine is\nproduced through fermentation caused by yeast cells.\nHe also proposed that microorganisms can cause disease and later developed\na method to remove microbes from food called pasteurizat ion.\nRobert Koch and Julius Petri§\n\nBecause of Louis Pasteur's work, it influenced Robert Koch who studied\nanthrax - a disease for cattle and sheep.\nHe is also one of the founders of bacteriology and discovered the bacteria\nresponsible for tuberculosis and cholera.\nHis assistant, Julius Petri, designed a shallow dish we know today as\nthe Petri dish.\nKoch then proposed that there are four conditions that proved a disease is\ncaused by a suspected bacteria. These are known as Koch's postulates.\nKoch's Postulates\n\nthe organism was present in every case of the disease\nit could be cultured outside the body\ninoculation of the culture caused the disease in an animal\nthe organism could be found in that animal\n\nMartinus Beijerinck and Dmitrii Ivanowski§\n\nThey were one of the founders of virology because of their work on\ntobacco mosaic viruses. They studied juices extracted from the leaves\nof plants infected with what is now known to be tobacco mosaic virus. They\nfiltered the juices to remove bacteria and found that even when highly diluted,\nthe liquid still could cause infection in plants. Ivanowski concluded that\nan infectious agent other than a bacterium—a filterable “virus”—led\nto the disease. Beijerinck called the substance “contagious living fluid.”\nWendell Stanley and Ernst Ruska§\n\nWendell Stanley further studied the tobacco mosaic virus and isolated\nthe crystals of the hypothesized disease-causing agents.\nBecause of the invention of the transmission electron microscope by Ernst\nRuska in 1933, this made it possible to observe viruses for the first time.\nRuska received the Nobel Prize in physics because of his transmission\nelectron microcoscope.\nAlexander Fleming§\n\nThe discovery of penicillin was nothing short of an accident. Alexander\nFleming was busy with other things so he left his laboratory uncleaned\nfor a few weeks.\nWhen he returned, he noticed some of his petri dishes have fungus on\nthem. But what interested him was there was no bacteria growing near the\nfungal contamination. There he identified this fungus as Penicillium rubens.\nThe mold or fungus produced an antibiotic substance for which he called\npenicillin.\nSummary - Historical Antecedents§\n\nThe most crucial tool that helped progress the field of microbiology is the microscope. Without such a tool, we wouldn't have progressed our understanding of life, diseases, and influence in our lives.\nMicrobes are an essential part of the biosphere, each of us filled with them.\nPasteur invented the pasteurization and increased food safety and food security.\nWendell Standley discovered the crystals that caused the tobacco mosaic disease.\nRuska invented the transmission electron microscope and helped further our understanding of viruses.\nEverything we know about medicine and diseases are thanks to the curiousity of those people who\nare always curious about the things around them.\nInvestigating microbial life§\n\nDefining life§\n\nThe smallest unit of life is the cell. Life will not exist without the\nexistence of this biological unit. But how do we define life? What are\nthe current consensus when it comes to the field of cell biology and\nmicrobiology? The answer is still, as of today, an open question.\nCurrently, these are the criteria that most biologists agree to say something\nis \"alive\":\n\nAble to respond to stimuli.\nAble to reproduce.\nMaintains homeostasis.\nHas growth and development.\nConsists of cells.\nHas complex biochemical processes.\n\n\nWe will have an open discussion about these. Prepare and study and do your\nown research for I will ask each of you regarding the following criteria.\n\nCells can either be unicellular or multicellular. However, cellular complexity\nis best described in terms of structure rather than the number of cells.\nProkaryotes§\n\nThe simplest cells are the prokaryotes. The name itself means \"before the nut\"\nas the words is a combination of two Greek words that are read as \"pro\" and\n\"karyon\".\nThese cells are simple in a sense these structures are enough for it to exist\n\nplasma membrane\nnucleoid\nplasmid\ncytoplasm\nribosomes\n\nAdditional extensions such as a \"cell wall\" and a flagellum may exist. Some even have hair-like\nextensions called as \"cillia\".\nEukaryotes§\n\nEukaryotes are more complex since they have a \"true nucleus\" and also contain small structures\ncalled organelles of which have specific functions. A table below explains those key\ndifferences.\nKey differences or similarities between a eukaryote and a prokaryote\nEukaryoteProkaryote\nNucleusNo nucleus\nMembrane-bound organellesNo membrane-bound organelles\nUnicellular &amp; MulticellularUnicellular (also in colonies)\nCircular DNALinear\nHas mitochondriaNo mitochondria\nAsexual and sexualAsexual\n\nWith that said, these organelles are small functional structures that help\neukaryotic cells live and thrive. Functions vary from waste management to\nenergy production.\nAs your task, define the function of the following membrane-bound\norganelles:\n\nmitochondria\nlysosome\nvacuole\nnucleus\ngolgi body\nrough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum\n\nPrepare for a quiz and an oral recitation next meeting.\nKey questions§\n\n\nThere are many membrane-bound organelles. Can you cite one example and\ndescribe its function?\nDo you think there are other criteria that can be added to define \"life\"?\nResearch about viruses. How is it that they are not considered \"alive\"?\nWe listed some notable mentions of scientists. Give another example who\nare also notable in this field and their contributions.\nWhat are the two modes of sexual reproduction? Define.\n\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-introduction-to-microbiology/","title":"Introduction to Microbiology"},"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/sts1-genetically-modified-organisms/":{"body":"Natural Selection§\n\nNatural selection is a known concept in the field of biology and life sciences. It talks about\nhow the environment change the organisms living in it to adapt and thrive in that environment. Otherwise,\nthese organisms are forced to move to other environments (e.g. habitats and ecosystems) or become extinct.\nThis concept was first recognized by Charles Darwin during his voyage to the Galapagos Islands\nand co-discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace who was exploring Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,\nwhich were known as the East Indies.\nIn relation to evolution§\n\nNatural selection is the actual driving force in evolution, where a new species or sub-species arises\nfrom the changes through various adaptations. Simply put, with enough time and luck, a species\nmay become another species if it wants to adapt in that environment. A new species may or may not\nbe able to breed with its ancestral species, and if it can, it is usually sterile or infertile e.g.\na cross between a donkey and a horse produces a sterile hinny or mule.\nConfusions about evolution§\n\nThere is a confusion caused by many traditional biologists about \"missing links\" and \"transitional forms\"\nin regards to evolution. The confusion is caused by the misinformation such as \"humans came from\nchimpanzees\" and whatnot. The truth is, every species is actually a transitional form. There is no\nactual specific point when it comes to evolution. It's always dynamic. Each of us may become an ancestor\nor a predecessor of some species we will never know. We can only define ourselves as \"closest relatives\"\nwith chimpanzees but no such thing as a \"common ancestor\", just the \"closest ancestor\".\nThis is not the fault of scientists. It's just that scientific communication sometimes simplify concepts a\nbit that it may cause confusion.\nEvidence§\n\nEvolution is not that clear to see at first because our perception time is not the same as evolutionary\ntime. The effects of natural selection takes thousands to millions of years for it to be noticeable.\nThe only way we can observe this is through fossils. Fossils are petrified remains of dead organisms\nthat can span even millions of years.\nFortunately, we can observe natural selection in microorganisms as they reproduce fast. In the modern\nage, we can observe this by reading articles about antimicrobial resistance in some species of\nbacteria or even experimenting it inside the laboratory.\nArtificial Selection§\n\nArtificial selection is one of the greatest evidence of natural selection. Except it's not caused by\nnature, but through careful selection of traits from us, human beings. We have practiced this concept\nwithout knowing it for thousands of years from domestication to agriculture. Dogs, cows, and corn\nare such examples of artificial selection. Through selective breeding, we achieved the desired traits\nwe want from these organisms. Another such good example would be the Brassica oleracea species because\npeople will not expect that cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower are actually the same species!\n\nGenetically Modified Organisms§\n\nAs we achieved the ability to modify and select genes, the field of bioengineering and genetic\nengineering has paved the way of accelerating our ability to quickly select the traits we want from\ndifferent organisms for food, raw materials, and medicine or drugs. These organisms are so-called\ngenetically modified organisms or GMOs.\nRelated links! Please watch them all. The last one is actually the best for me.\n\nWhy do we have GMOs?\nAre GMOs Good or Bad?\nPamela Ronald: The case of engineering our food\n\nFood Security and Safety, and Agriculture§\n\nAs the world population grows exponentially, there is also an increasing demand of food production\nand also an increase chance of a new disease affecting those that consume and those that are consumed.\nGenetically modified organisms with the power of genetic engineering can mitigate or even remove\nthose threats to food security and safety. Genetic engineers and geneticists can look for the gene\nthat increases food production or increases resilience against disease. Sometimes even add another\ntrait of that GMO to have a specific nutrient or nutrients to fight malnutrition in poverty-stricken\nregions. Some crops can be even modified to be resilient to the effects of climate change such as flood\nresilient rice or salt resilient fruit trees.\nMedicine§\n\nGMOs can help us produce or increase the quality of our medicine. It may also help us find new ways\nor new kinds of medicine to produce. Insulin for example were already produced by genetically modified\nbacteria, specifically, E. coli.\nGMOs are more consistent and don't carry the same risks than traditional medicine because they can be\nlab produced, therefore, has more of a controlled setting. We can genetically modify organisms to be\nresilient or produce the drugs for us such as insulin, or even vitamins that are commonly deficient\nin young people.\nReview§\n\n\nList 5 things that are the result or product of GMOs.\nAre GMOs bad or good? Explain.\nHow does genetic engineering help us mitigate the effects of climate change?\nList down at least one species of plant that was saved from extinction\nthrough genetic engineering.\n\nList of terms and definitions§\n\nGenetically Modified Organism (GMO): An organism whose genetic material has been altered using genetic engineering techniques. GMOs are created by introducing genes from one species into another to confer specific traits or characteristics.\nGenetic Engineering: The manipulation and alteration of an organism's genetic material to introduce or modify specific traits. It involves isolating, modifying, and reintroducing DNA sequences into an organism to produce desired characteristics.\nTransgene: A gene that has been transferred from one organism to another through genetic engineering. The transgene can be from the same or a different species and is typically used to confer specific traits or characteristics to the recipient organism.\nRecombinant DNA (rDNA): DNA molecules formed by combining DNA sequences from different sources or species. Recombinant DNA technology is a key tool in genetic engineering, allowing the creation of transgenic organisms.\nGene Splicing: The process of cutting and recombining DNA sequences from different sources, typically performed in the laboratory to create new combinations of genes. Gene splicing is used to insert foreign genes into an organism's genome.\nBiotechnology: The application of biological and genetic engineering techniques to develop products and solutions that improve living organisms, industrial processes, and medical treatments. It encompasses a wide range of practices, including genetic engineering and the use of GMOs.\nSelective Breeding: The traditional method of breeding plants or animals with desirable traits to create offspring with those same traits. Selective breeding is not considered genetic engineering because it involves the selection of naturally occurring genetic variation rather than the introduction of foreign genes.\nHerbicide Resistance: The ability of a plant to withstand the application of specific herbicides without being damaged. Herbicide-resistant GMOs are created by introducing genes that produce enzymes or proteins that break down or deactivate the herbicide.\nPest Resistance: The ability of a plant to resist damage caused by pests, such as insects, viruses, or fungi. Pest-resistant GMOs are created by introducing genes that produce toxins harmful to pests or genes that enhance the plant's own defense mechanisms.\nGene Editing: A set of techniques used to modify an organism's genome by precisely altering its DNA sequence. Gene editing tools like CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) allow scientists to make targeted changes in an organism's genes without necessarily introducing foreign genes.\nGenome: The complete set of genetic material (DNA) of an organism, including all of its genes. The genome contains the instructions for building and maintaining an organism.\nGene Transfer: The process of transferring genes from one organism to another. It can occur naturally through processes like sexual reproduction or artificially through genetic engineering techniques.\nMarker Gene: A gene introduced into an organism's genome during genetic engineering to serve as a selectable or observable marker. Marker genes are used to identify and track the presence of the desired transgene in the recipient organism.\nAntibiotic Resistance Marker: A common type of marker gene used in genetic engineering. It provides resistance to antibiotics, allowing researchers to selectively identify and cultivate cells or organisms that have successfully incorporated the desired transgene.\nMolecular Farming: The use of genetically modified plants or animals to produce valuable substances, such as pharmaceuticals, vaccines, or industrial enzymes. These organisms act as \"factories\" for the production of high-value compounds.\nSynthetic Biology: An interdisciplinary field that combines biology, engineering, and computer science to design and construct new biological parts, devices, and systems. It involves the creation of synthetic DNA sequences and the engineering of novel biological functions.\nGenetic Modification Techniques: Various methods used to introduce foreign genes or modify an organism's DNA. These techniques include gene splicing, gene editing, and RNA interference (RNAi), among others.\nBiofortification: The process of enhancing the nutritional content of food crops through genetic engineering. Biofortified crops are designed to contain higher levels of specific vitamins, minerals, or other beneficial compounds.\nEnvironmental Impact Assessment: A process to evaluate the potential environmental risks and benefits associated with the release of GMOs into the environment. It helps identify and minimize any potential adverse effects on ecosystems, biodiversity, or human health.\nCoexistence: The simultaneous cultivation of genetically modified and non-genetically modified crops or the raising of genetically modified and non-genetically modified organisms in close proximity. Coexistence measures aim to ensure that GMOs and conventional crops can coexist without significant cross-pollination or other unintended effects.\nBiosafety: The discipline concerned with ensuring the safe handling, transport, use, and disposal of GMOs. Biosafety measures and regulations are in place to prevent potential risks to human health, animal health, and the environment.\n","id":"https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/sts1-genetically-modified-organisms/","title":"Genetically Modified
