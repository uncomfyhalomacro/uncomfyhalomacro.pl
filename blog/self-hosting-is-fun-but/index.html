My current plans after this is to start donating to <a href=https://codeberg.org>Codeberg</a>, starting July. The reason why I decided to self-host is page load. My website, despite being a static website, is slow to load because of Codeberg Pages. Codeberg Pages is fine actually, but at some points in time it does a bit weird. This is probably because the data centers are in Germany or somewhere in Europe while I am in the Philippines.<p>The self-hosting provider I use for here is <a href=https://www.linode.com/>Linode</a>. But I plan to change after a month. I think I am looking at <a href=https://contabo.com>Contabo</a> next. More reasons why below.<h1 id=about-linode>About Linode<a aria-label="Anchor link for: about-linode" class=zola-anchor href=#about-linode>¬ß</a></h1><p>Linode. Hmm. I can't give much opinions about it. This is my first time trying out self-hosting after all.<p>The pricing is in my opinion, could be better? Not sure. Now that I found out about <a href=https://contabo.com>Contabo</a>, I plan to ditch this instance and move over.<p>Documentation is actually there in Linode but most of it is either outdated or possibly wrong? I have a lot of things I read from the docs that did not work well for me so I read official sources instead aka <strong>the</strong> documentation of the software I am going to use. They could have done it better I guess <strong>and they lack docs for openSUSE too</strong> üò¢.<p>I plan to have two compute instances in <a href=https://contabo.com>Contabo</a> because I plan to use the other instance for a database, and also self-hosting <a href=https://woodpecker-ci.org>Woodpecker CI</a>. Possibly I will add other services as well such as<ul><li>NextCloud<li>VaultWarden (Bitwarden basically) or I just use password-store.<li>Collabora Office</ul><p>I might share one of these services to my family or friends I guess.<p>The reason being, for experience and it's also very fun.<h1 id=what-i-learned-so-far>What I learned so far<a aria-label="Anchor link for: what-i-learned-so-far" class=zola-anchor href=#what-i-learned-so-far>¬ß</a></h1><h2 id=experimenting-forgejo>Experimenting Forgejo<a aria-label="Anchor link for: experimenting-forgejo" class=zola-anchor href=#experimenting-forgejo>¬ß</a></h2><p>It would be a waste to not use the remaining compute resources so I decided to give <a href=https://forgejo.org>Forgejo</a> a <a href=https://go.dev/>Go</a>. üòâ<p>Forgejo is available now in openSUSE. Although, I am quite confused by the systemd service but now I understand the implications for why it was decided not to use the home directory of whatever invokes the <code>forgejo</code> binary. This was discussed in the https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Security_Features#Systemd_hardening_effort.<p>Anyhow, I had a lot of hiccups configuring <a href=https://forgejo.org>Forgejo</a> but I just decided to just use whatever that systemd script has and just edit the file to point to a custom config by running<pre class="language-bash z-code" data-lang=bash><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash><span class="z-source z-shell z-bash"><span class="z-variable z-other z-readwrite z-assignment z-shell">EDITOR</span><span class="z-keyword z-operator z-assignment z-shell">=</span><span class="z-string z-unquoted z-shell">kak</span> <span class="z-meta z-function-call z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-function z-shell">systemctl</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell"> edit<span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> --</span>full</span> forgejo.service</span>
</span></code></pre><p>specifically, I edited the line containing <code>ExecStart=</code>.<blockquote><p><code>EDITOR=kak</code> is so annoying. openSUSE does have a way to set this by adding that to <code>/etc/profile.local</code>. Local configs or those that are suffixed with <code>*.local</code> is unique to openSUSE. Users are encouraged to edit the local configs rather than the defaults. This is how I got so confused at first when trying it out the first time. Also, this explains why I also edit the apache config at a different file instead of the <code>httpd.conf</code> file. Specifically, by editing <code>/etc/sysconfig/apache2</code> ü•¥.</blockquote><p>Anyway, the site is up at <a href=https://forgejo.uncomfyhalomacro.pl>https://forgejo.uncomfyhalomacro.pl</a>. Feel free to take a look around. However, <strong>registrations are closed</strong> so if you want to make an account, you are not able to unless we are friends. ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are my friend, do keep in mind that this is experimental and still possible that I will kill this instance. Once I get the hang of it, I will start putting my projects to the self-hosted vm.<p>Another issue I have is setting the <code>[mailer]</code> configuration. Because it seems to be not working to be honest and I am not sure why. I filed a ticket to my mail provider if MTA is part of their service because I might be mistaken.<h2 id=nginx>Nginx<a aria-label="Anchor link for: nginx" class=zola-anchor href=#nginx>¬ß</a></h2><p>To manage redirects and subdomain URLs, I tried my hand at Nginx. I read it as ngeenx and not like 'engine X' or like how I read Lynx.<h3 id=first-impressions>First Impressions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: first-impressions" class=zola-anchor href=#first-impressions>¬ß</a></h3><p>The language looks like <a href=https://kdl.dev/>KDL</a>. I actually do not know what Nginx use but whatever. The syntax confuses me a lot to be honest and I really don't like how it looks when configuring. Some of you might find the language simple. But what really confused me a lot is doing redirects. I guess I didn't read enough documentation ü•¥.<h3 id=certbot-integration-impressions>Certbot Integration Impressions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: certbot-integration-impressions" class=zola-anchor href=#certbot-integration-impressions>¬ß</a></h3><p>Certbot integration is nice. The pressing issue is when certbot rewrites files for Nginx. This causes a lot of confusion to me because the rewritten configs to point to the SSL certificates are faulty and can cause misredirects. I have to manually edit the files to be honest.<h2 id=apache>Apache<a aria-label="Anchor link for: apache" class=zola-anchor href=#apache>¬ß</a></h2><p>I am not sure why but after the onslaught of trying Nginx, I decided to use Apache.<h3 id=first-impressions-1>First Impressions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: first-impressions-1" class=zola-anchor href=#first-impressions-1>¬ß</a></h3><p>I got pampered by openSUSE because it contains templates at <code>/etc/apache2/vhosts.d</code>. At first, I was so confused because when I read the default config at <code>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</code>, the documentation from Linode and other sources conflict because openSUSE's default config has a lot of comments to discourage the use of it. Instead, I have to edit <code>/etc/sysconfig/apache2</code> and add a new file <code>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf.local</code>. This file is added to <code>/etc/sysconfig/apache2</code>, specifically, <code>APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES</code>. Here is a snippet of the updated sysconfig.<pre class=z-code><code><span class="z-text z-plain"># Here you can name files, separated by spaces, that should be Include'd from 
</span><span class="z-text z-plain"># httpd.conf. 
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">#
</span><span class="z-text z-plain"># This allows you to add e.g. VirtualHost statements without touching 
</span><span class="z-text z-plain"># /etc/apache2/httpd.conf itself, which makes upgrading easier. 
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">#
</span><span class="z-text z-plain">APACHE_CONF_INCLUDE_FILES="/etc/apache2/httpd.conf.local"
</span></code></pre><h3 id=better-syntax-plugins-and-tooling>Better syntax, plugins, and tooling<a aria-label="Anchor link for: better-syntax-plugins-and-tooling" class=zola-anchor href=#better-syntax-plugins-and-tooling>¬ß</a></h3><p>I am not saying that I did not have difficulty using Apache. But as I roamed around the Internet, I just found out that it uses utility tools that helps installs plugins. As of writing, I have added the <code>filter</code> and <code>deflate</code> module. The latter was already added by default but the <code>filter</code> module was not. This was to enhance page loads (yeah I know it's a static site ü§£) but a small speed up helps ü§™.<p>It's also easy to just add additional subdomains as well in <code>/etc/apache2/vhosts.d</code>. You just have to configure if what you want is a reverse proxy and a redirect or serve directly the directory specifically those in <code>/srv/www/vhosts</code>.<h3 id=certbot-integration-impressions-1>Certbot Integration Impressions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: certbot-integration-impressions-1" class=zola-anchor href=#certbot-integration-impressions-1>¬ß</a></h3><p>I am just going to say that the integration with certbot is amazing. Even as to correctly configure my configs. Running <code>certbot --apache -d mydomain.com -d other.mydomain.com</code> is a breeze. It will add a new file corresponding to the config name with <code>-le-ssl.conf</code> suffix. I just add a small modification but so far only to the one that contains <code>www.mydomain.com</code>.<h2 id=dns>DNS<a aria-label="Anchor link for: dns" class=zola-anchor href=#dns>¬ß</a></h2><p>In regards to DNS, I have some issues configuring it. I manage to learn more about A/AAAA and CNAME records. So far, it's all good and working.<p>I am just surprised that I don't know how long it will really propagate. One hiccup I made before was a mistypo of configuring spam reputation for a mail provider I use for my custom domain. And yes, it did propagate the domain and because of that, I have or had an ephemeral URL domain <code>autoconfig.mydomain.com</code> which points to my atuin instance. It's gone now.<h1 id=closing-thoughts>Closing Thoughts<a aria-label="Anchor link for: closing-thoughts" class=zola-anchor href=#closing-thoughts>¬ß</a></h1><p>Self-hosting is a fun idea. Although, I might be looking at other hosting solutions like Contabo. I heard they have a good price over ratio but I also heard mixed reviews from different communities e.g. they lower the quality of network bandwidth (?) but I can't seem to see what's the issue yet so I might have to experience that myself.</section></article></div><section class=webring><h3>Articles from blogs I follow around the net</h3><section class=articles><div class=article><h4 class=title dir=auto><a href=https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/go-concurrency-patterns/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Go Concurrency Patterns</a></h4><p class=summary dir=auto>Goroutines Channels Select Statement Wait Groups Mutex Conditions Atomic Operations Once Context Map Real Examples Goroutines The go keyword is used to start a goroutine.
