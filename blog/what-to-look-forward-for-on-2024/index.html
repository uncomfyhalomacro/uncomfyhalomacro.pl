I have lots of plans for next year and I was hoping they won't go awry, at least.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><p>So my plans are probably the following:<ul><li>slowing down maintenance cycles as a packager.<li>improving my knowledge of Wayland.<li>improving my knowledge on Julia.<li>improving my knowledge on databases e.g. SQL and PostGres.<li>improving my knowledge on my field of expertise once I proceed with my undegraduate studies.<li>advocating for the usage of Open Source software.<li>probably leaving OSSPH once 2024 ends.</ul><h1 id=slowing-down-maintenance-cycles-as-a-packager>Slowing down maintenance cycles as a packager<a aria-label="Anchor link for: slowing-down-maintenance-cycles-as-a-packager" class=zola-anchor href=#slowing-down-maintenance-cycles-as-a-packager>§</a></h1><p>It has been 2 years since I started packaging for software for <a href=https://get.opensuse.org>openSUSE</a>. I have fun but it has taken a lot of my time to fix, to add patches, and to update versions of packages that I even sometimes forget what is the most important. For now, expect that I will mostly focus on updating packages related to Rust, Wayland, and Julia. I hope there are contributors out there who can fill that time gap if anything important arises. Anyone who are willing enough can check out the <a href=https://en.opensuse.org/Category:Packaging_documentation>wiki</a> for packaging documentation.<h1 id=improving-my-knowledge-of-wayland>Improving my knowledge of Wayland<a aria-label="Anchor link for: improving-my-knowledge-of-wayland" class=zola-anchor href=#improving-my-knowledge-of-wayland>§</a></h1><p>My knowledge of Wayland was postponed on 2023. I was planning to learn but personal time (mostly laziness) took most of the chances to learn Wayland (and other stuff). My plan for next year is learn how to write a Wayland client with the help of my friends on <a href=https://waycrate.github.io/>Waycrate</a>. I felt sorry for Aakash doing all the work and maintenance. I am glad that there are people that like to contribute at least. Thanks Andreas and shootingstardragon.<h1 id=improving-my-knowledge-on-julia>Improving my knowledge on Julia<a aria-label="Anchor link for: improving-my-knowledge-on-julia" class=zola-anchor href=#improving-my-knowledge-on-julia>§</a></h1><p>Julia. Oh yeah I forgot. This language was supposed to be my favorite language until I became a Rust fanboi. Most of my knowledge on <a href=https://julialang.org>Julia</a> is back to zero. I literally don't know anything now about the language so it seems. I am planning to refresh next year by writing a pure Julia package for the <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/>RDF</a> specification, a W3C standard for graph data. This is quite related to a postponed package for SBOL3.jl. Although, writing that package after finishing for RDF package in Julia is mutually exclusive. I can choose not to write for SBOL.<h1 id=improving-my-knowledge-on-databases>Improving my knowledge on databases<a aria-label="Anchor link for: improving-my-knowledge-on-databases" class=zola-anchor href=#improving-my-knowledge-on-databases>§</a></h1><p>I have little experience with databases but I can still remember some SQL since highschool. Although, I won't say that I have like, <em>enough knowledge</em> to be able to do some stuff. I lack the experience to deploy and integrate databases with any programming language I have tried or used. So yes, I hope 2024 allows me to learn them.<h1 id=improving-my-field-of-expertise>Improving my field of expertise<a aria-label="Anchor link for: improving-my-field-of-expertise" class=zola-anchor href=#improving-my-field-of-expertise>§</a></h1><p>I finished my undergraduate studies on Biology specializing in Microbiology. However, it's now the time to consider enrolling for my graduate studies probably a branch or somewhat an interrelated field. I will check out soon next school year 2024-2025. For now, it's a plan. I still need to keep my job at a private university.<h1 id=advocating-for-the-usage-of-oss>Advocating for the usage of OSS<a aria-label="Anchor link for: advocating-for-the-usage-of-oss" class=zola-anchor href=#advocating-for-the-usage-of-oss>§</a></h1><p>For a few years, I am using a lot of OSS. From various editors to office suites and even writing this blog, I have learned them through my curiousity and enthusiasm to learn OSS. I plan to share them to the private university I work for by raising awareness about costs and advantages of using OSS.<h1 id=probably-leaving-ossph-once-2024-ends>Probably leaving OSSPH once 2024 ends<a aria-label="Anchor link for: probably-leaving-ossph-once-2024-ends" class=zola-anchor href=#probably-leaving-ossph-once-2024-ends>§</a></h1><p>I am planning to leave <a href=https://ossph.org/>OSSPH</a> or <em><strong>specifically step down</strong></em>. Not too sure why (it's probably cryptocurrency and Web3). I feel like the community have little impact to what I do in my life so I guess it's time to plan that ahead unless anything changes.<h1 id=non-tech-and-non-academic-related-plans>Non-tech and non-academic related plans<a aria-label="Anchor link for: non-tech-and-non-academic-related-plans" class=zola-anchor href=#non-tech-and-non-academic-related-plans>§</a></h1><p>I plan to get regular workouts next year even just light exercises. I am gaining weight slowly and it's kind of sad that my plan to maintain around 64 kilograms is now nearing 72 kilograms.<p>I also plan to mitigate my procrastination. It's hard. And it caused a lot of woes this year. I don't know why I procrastinate but I have a feeling it's due to my subconscious telling me "what you're doing is not worth it". I would like to know why but I think I have an answer. It's time to tire myself out positively 🫡.<p>I also plan to increase my reach from various parts of communities be it tech or biology so I hope 2024 is a blast.<h1 id=so-uh>So uh...<a aria-label="Anchor link for: so-uh" class=zola-anchor href=#so-uh>§</a></h1><p>Yes. By January, I will postpone all programming activities and software maintenance unless someone emails me that a package needs to be updated. I will resume such activities starting February.</section></article></div><section class=webring><h3>Articles from blogs I follow around the net</h3><section class=articles><div class=article><h4 class=title dir=auto><a href=https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/go-concurrency-patterns/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Go Concurrency Patterns</a></h4><p class=summary dir=auto>Goroutines Channels Select Statement Wait Groups Mutex Conditions Atomic Operations Once Context Map Real Examples Goroutines The go keyword is used to start a goroutine.
