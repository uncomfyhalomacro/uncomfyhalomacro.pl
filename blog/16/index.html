Like any Linux distribution, it provides loads of quality software for many users and supports modern systems.<p>Try out openSUSE by following the link <a href=https://get.opensuse.org>https://get.opensuse.org</a>.<h1 id=when-i-hopped-over-to-opensuse>When I hopped over to openSUSE<a aria-label="Anchor link for: when-i-hopped-over-to-opensuse" class=zola-anchor href=#when-i-hopped-over-to-opensuse>¬ß</a></h1><p><strong>IT WAS NOT GOOD</strong>. Keyword "was". Hear me out. I tried out openSUSE around the year 2020.</p><img alt="caught in 4k joining opensuse" src=./os-discord-screenshot.webp style=width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block><p>I joined openSUSE Discord but left as soon as I realized the mirror situation. I complained like <em><strong>a lot</strong></em>. The distribution is actually very good. I just don't want to live in a time where I suffer from slow updates. It's why I came back to <a href=https://manjarno.snorlax.sh>Manjarno</a>.<p>But before we get into the part where I <a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/16/#i-hopped-back-to-opensuse-twice>hopped back</a> to openSUSE, let me talk about the brief history of my Linux journey.<h1 id=my-linux-journey>My Linux Journey<a aria-label="Anchor link for: my-linux-journey" class=zola-anchor href=#my-linux-journey>¬ß</a></h1><p>So my Linux journey started around the year 2019 when the COVID-19 pandemic happened. My old laptop became slow around that time. To save money and to avoid the cost of buying a new laptop, we bought replacement parts and while waiting for them to arrive, I decided to try Linux on the month of May of 2020. Windows 10 became so slow on my old machine and I was thinking, "I know I am smart enough to read books and manuals, so why not Linux?". I got my flashdrive, downloaded <a href=https://www.debian.org>Debian</a> Stable, burned the ISO to the flashdrive through <a href=https://rufus.ie>Rufus</a> and then just basically wiped Windows and replaced it with Debian. I was pretty sure the first DE I tried was KDE Plasma.<p>The distributions I tried are actually enough for writing, presenting, and schooling!<h2 id=arch-linux-for-the-new-year-of-2021>Arch Linux for the new year of 2021<a aria-label="Anchor link for: arch-linux-for-the-new-year-of-2021" class=zola-anchor href=#arch-linux-for-the-new-year-of-2021>¬ß</a></h2><p>I was very curious of <a href=https://archlinux.org>Arch Linux</a> and the hype around the distribution. It turns out, the appealing aspect of Arch was the fact that you can modify and install what you want on this distribution. I daily drived it <em>with some hopping over to other *nix distributions of course (such as FreeBSD which is not a linux distribution)</em>.<h2 id=the-rest-of-the-stuff-is-distrohopping-facepalm-male>The rest of the stuff is distrohopping ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è<a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-rest-of-the-stuff-is-distrohopping-facepalm-male" class=zola-anchor href=#the-rest-of-the-stuff-is-distrohopping-facepalm-male>¬ß</a></h2><p>I mean if we want to breakdown all the distros I tried, not just Linux, here it is:<ul><li>2020 <ul><li>Debian<li>Xubuntu<li>Manjaro<li>Artix</ul><li>2021 <ul><li>Arch<li>Void<li>Fedora<li>FreeBSD</ul></ul><p>In 2022, I daily drived Void Linux from January to June-ish. Once my new laptop arrived, I then just full hopped on Fedora, only to be disappointed, I forgot what it was though. Went to Arch for a little bit. Then I came back top openSUSE.<h1 id=i-hopped-back-to-opensuse-twice>I hopped back to openSUSE. Twice.<a aria-label="Anchor link for: i-hopped-back-to-opensuse-twice" class=zola-anchor href=#i-hopped-back-to-opensuse-twice>¬ß</a></h1><p>It was 2021. I hopped back to openSUSE and uh, the mirror situation was still not great. I will have to time it every late at night just for an update to complete by the next day... <em>imagine that</em>...<p>But I persevered. It's annoying enough to hop back and forth only because of the mirrors but I believed and hoped that improvements of the mirror situation. And someone did improve it!!!<h2 id=firstyear-steps-in>Firstyear steps in<a aria-label="Anchor link for: firstyear-steps-in" class=zola-anchor href=#firstyear-steps-in>¬ß</a></h2><p>I tried many mirrors around and I was not very happy. Many times, I either get an outdated mirror or a dead mirror.<p><a href=https://github.com/firstyear>Firstyear</a> was one of the victims of the mirror situation. I think at that time, he was exploring some ways on how to fix the mirror issue. Because he is not just a user, the mirror situation affected his work. tl;dr he works at <a href=https://www.suse.com>SUSE LLC</a> and mirrors were bad.<p>Here are some screenshots of our conversation in <a href=https://discord.gg/opensuse>openSUSE Discord</a> regarding mirrors:<p>I was probably a few days late for an update but oh well...</p><img alt="firstyear and I talking about my situation" src=./its-time.webp style=width:70%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block><img alt="firstyear complaining about the mirror situation" src=./firstyear-complains.webp style=width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block><p>Basically, he just did a Thanos move.</p><img alt="fine. i will do it myself" src=https://media.tenor.com/u8YEMwIfJGMAAAAC/thanos.gif style=width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block><p>It took a while. Or more like a year before it has improved.<h2 id=took-a-while>Took a while<a aria-label="Anchor link for: took-a-while" class=zola-anchor href=#took-a-while>¬ß</a></h2><p>It did took another year after that because there were still some rough edges.<p>So I came back to Void for quite a while until 2022 happened. I came back again for openSUSE for the reason that I feel like I do not really belong in the Void community. I felt at home to openSUSE so it's why I came back. And I came back with improved infrastructure because Firstyear and co-contributors finally solved the mirror issue!</p><img alt="im officially back" src=./im-officially-back.webp style=width:60%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;display:block><p>And I stayed using openSUSE until the time I was writing this. üò≥<h1 id=why-opensuse>Why openSUSE <i class="fa-brands fa-suse"></i>?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: why-opensuse" class=zola-anchor href=#why-opensuse>¬ß</a></h1><p>openSUSE is a very underrated distribution. I don't care much about the controversies for why that is, people like to gossip including myself :P<p>Anyway, I chose openSUSE because for many reasons but here are the major ones.<h2 id=easier-to-contribute>Easier to contribute<a aria-label="Anchor link for: easier-to-contribute" class=zola-anchor href=#easier-to-contribute>¬ß</a></h2><p>Unlike other distros that I tried, openSUSE seems to be open on encouraging users to contribute in various parts of the distribution from the openSUSE Build Services, the openSUSE Wiki, and packaging.<p>I learned mostly about packaging because it's that area that I am most interested in when I tried openSUSE. Firstyear taught me about the RPM specification and RPM specfiles. As of writing, I managed to package at least 10 software, mostly related to Rust or Wayland such as <code>mdbook</code>, <code>swww</code>, and <code>xdg-desktop-hyprland</code>.<h2 id=amazing-community>Amazing community<a aria-label="Anchor link for: amazing-community" class=zola-anchor href=#amazing-community>¬ß</a></h2><p>I met lots of talented and skilled individuals in openSUSE that I really just want to steal their brain and make theirs mine.<p>There are a lot of people as well that are humorous and funny to a point I really like to lurk there sometimes.<p>But again, that's because we have amazing moderators.<h2 id=i-learned-a-lot>I learned a lot<a aria-label="Anchor link for: i-learned-a-lot" class=zola-anchor href=#i-learned-a-lot>¬ß</a></h2><p>When I joined openSUSE, I learned lives of different people there and met some fellow people who use different kind of OSes. I learned about their perspectives in the tech community. And I think being in openSUSE really opened my eyes that there is much more than "free" and "open-source software". Various people have different reasons of using Linux.<h2 id=would-i-still-use-opensuse-forever>Would I still use openSUSE forever?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: would-i-still-use-opensuse-forever" class=zola-anchor href=#would-i-still-use-opensuse-forever>¬ß</a></h2><p>Depends. Maybe in the future my needs may become entirely different. I have been eyeing on reproducibility where I can predict my current setup is the same across different machines such as NixOS and other immutable distributions such as openSUSE Aeon and Fedora Silverblue.<p>But I won't forget about the openSUSE community ‚ò∫Ô∏è</section></article></div><section class=webring><h3>Articles from blogs I follow around the net</h3><section class=articles><div class=article><h4 class=title dir=auto><a href=https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/go-concurrency-patterns/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Go Concurrency Patterns</a></h4><p class=summary dir=auto>Goroutines Channels Select Statement Wait Groups Mutex Conditions Atomic Operations Once Context Map Real Examples Goroutines The go keyword is used to start a goroutine.
