I have little information about the company but it seems it's well known from various tech people I met.<h1 id=first-impressions>First impressions<a aria-label="Anchor link for: first-impressions" class=zola-anchor href=#first-impressions>Â§</a></h1><p>When I went to their website, it looks so clean and green like the "green energy" message they have on their landing page.<p><img alt="Mailbox Dot Org Landing Page" src=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/first-impressions-on-my-first-non-google-email-provider/./landing-page-mailbox.webp><p>But sadly, when I bought for their services, I was not really impressed by their web client. It was... uncared for? I am not sure why the landing page looks so cool but the placement for their settings is so weird. Here are a list of screenshots so you would understand what I mean.<p><img alt="The web client" src=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/first-impressions-on-my-first-non-google-email-provider/./webclient.webp><p>Another nitpick is the inconsistency of the tooltip. It should show the tooltip <em>when the selection happens</em> and NOT <em>after you are centered on the button</em>.<p><img alt=Tooltip src=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/first-impressions-on-my-first-non-google-email-provider/./buttons.gif><p>Also, when clicking settings, I have to click... <em>twice</em>? One for the gear icon, which will create two options as a drop-down; one for settings, and one for "connect your device". That's the weirdest way to navigate to settings. It's subtle but it's such a <strong>huge</strong> inconsistency. Kind of a missed opportunity.<p><img alt="Inconsistent gear button" src=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/first-impressions-on-my-first-non-google-email-provider/./gear-setting-inconsistency.webp><h2 id=then-what>Then what?<a aria-label="Anchor link for: then-what" class=zola-anchor href=#then-what>Â§</a></h2><p>For other stuff, it was alright. But it feels so dated. It's good since it's light I am fine with that. I just don't know why the placement/behavior of the buttons/settings are all over the place. Maybe I am wrong? If anyone reading this is a front-end designer or specializes in UI/UX, please tell me if I am wrong.<h1 id=services>Services<a aria-label="Anchor link for: services" class=zola-anchor href=#services>Â§</a></h1><p>Well enough of the UI, how about their services?<p>So I bought the 9EUR per month <em>monthly plan</em> which amounts to 545.74PHPâ€”<em><strong>Premium Plan</strong></em>:<ul><li>Mail Storage of 25GB<li>Cloud Storage of 50GB<li>25 Mail aliases<li>Allows 250 aliases for custom domains<li>Gets more support <ul><li>Online office<li>Priority & phone</ul></ul><p>Sounds great? To be honest, I bought this plan because I want to try the most expensive offering.<p>But it's too early to tell so I will try this for a year and get the yearly plan. So I will get a month using the monthly plan and once for the yearly plan; a total of 13 months. Unlucky!<p>I will be going to skip a bit of the features since I haven't got used to it yet. But one thing that interests me to use more and more is the DavFS/WebDav feature. Although, their documentation was not really accurate nor informative about it. Yes, they have a documentation but what I mean is, it feels rushed.<p>Other features are mentioned in https://mailbox.org/en/private-customers#price-plans.<h1 id=overall>Overall<a aria-label="Anchor link for: overall" class=zola-anchor href=#overall>Â§</a></h1><p>Again, it's too early to say anything. But one thing I already did is "forwarding" all my emails from my previous Gmail account to my new mailbox email addresses and aliases. And I already copied almost all of my old inboxes to my new inboxes.<h1 id=other-considerations>Other considerations<a aria-label="Anchor link for: other-considerations" class=zola-anchor href=#other-considerations>Â§</a></h1><p>I was eyeing for <a href=https://www.fastmail.com/>Fastmail</a> since<ol><li>It's recommended by my mentor (bias)<li>It's in Aussieland, so it's closer. And also the only email service near southeast asia because Asia seems to have no email service company. <em>Kind of makes sense, but I will keep it to myself</em> ðŸ˜›<li>Has more enticing offerings and features. At the same price, you get 100GB and 600+ aliases.<li>Probably has a better UI for their web client. Their website says it all.</ol><p>For now, I will be using this for a year.</section></article></div><section class=webring><h3>Articles from blogs I follow around the net</h3><section class=articles><div class=article><h4 class=title dir=auto><a href=https://www.integralist.co.uk/posts/go-concurrency-patterns/ rel=noopener target=_blank>Go Concurrency Patterns</a></h4><p class=summary dir=auto>Goroutines Channels Select Statement Wait Groups Mutex Conditions Atomic Operations Once Context Map Real Examples Goroutines The go keyword is used to start a goroutine.
