Epidemiology covers the topic of epidemics and pandemics, immunization, and <em>spillovers</em> (an event where pathogen's host jump over one species to another).<p>It may be defined as the study of distribution of health and disease in <em>groups of people</em> as described by "Biostatistics and Epidemiology" from Sylvia Wassertheil-Smoller and Jordan Smoller.<h1 id=definition-of-disease>Definition of Disease<a aria-label="Anchor link for: definition-of-disease" class=zola-anchor href=#definition-of-disease>§</a></h1><p>A <em>disease</em> are actually a combination of two words: dis, and ease. This means that a <em>disease</em> in its true meaning is discomfort or the feeling of uneasiness.<p>Diseases exist because of many factors. This may include body's health in terms of nutrient intake, or the existence of pathogens that wreak havoc within their host's body. A disease may be obesity, <strong>a physical condition</strong>, or pneumonia, an <strong>infection</strong>.<p>In epidemiology, understanding the "what", the "why", and the "how" in diseases is helpful in health care planning, emergence of patterns, formation of hypothesis, and formulation standards in medical practice.<h1 id=mortality-and-morbidity>Mortality and Morbidity<a aria-label="Anchor link for: mortality-and-morbidity" class=zola-anchor href=#mortality-and-morbidity>§</a></h1><p>These two terms are sometimes confused with each other. But in epidemiology, there are some differences.<blockquote><p><em>Mortality is about the <strong>incidence</strong></em>. Incidence is the number of new cases at a specific period of time. Whereas, morbidity is expressed as <em>incidence</em> or <em>prevalence</em>. Prevalence is the number of <em><strong>existing</strong></em> cases over a specific period of time, and thay may also include new cases as well.</blockquote><p>So if someone talks about <em>mortality rate</em>, they are talking about <em>incidence</em>.<p>In reality, doing a survey or consensus for disease prevalence is easier because you will just need a sample of a population for counting the cases of disease on that specific period of time. Incidence is hard because you will have to observe a sample of <em>healthy</em> individuals until they manifest the disease.<h1 id=epidemic-pandemic-and-endemic>Epidemic, Pandemic, and Endemic<a aria-label="Anchor link for: epidemic-pandemic-and-endemic" class=zola-anchor href=#epidemic-pandemic-and-endemic>§</a></h1><p>An epidemic is a significant number of cases of a disease over a localized area in a period of time. A pandemic is just an epidemic but all over the globe. An endemic happens all over the world as well. There is a difference though. Both pandemic and epidemic threatens the health of many people and the chance to recover from that disease or may even cause significant amount of deaths. Whereas, an endemic disease can happen over a lifetime with predictable number of infections. An endemic disease may evolve further into either an epidemic or a pandemic depending on the evolution of the pathogen that causes the disease.<hr><h1 id=infectious-diseases>Infectious Diseases<a aria-label="Anchor link for: infectious-diseases" class=zola-anchor href=#infectious-diseases>§</a></h1><p>Diseases caused by organisms such as bacteria, parasites, and viruses are called <em>infectious diseases</em> or <em>communicable diseases</em>. These disease-causing organisms are also called <em><strong>pathogens</strong></em>. Our body has an internal environment suitable for microbial growth, thereby, making us prime targets for <em>infectious diseases</em>.<h2 id=pathogens-or-infectious-agents>Pathogens or Infectious Agents<a aria-label="Anchor link for: pathogens-or-infectious-agents" class=zola-anchor href=#pathogens-or-infectious-agents>§</a></h2><p>A pathogen is a disease-causing organism. Its goal is to invade, multiply, and overwhelm their host. The host may experience physiological, behavioral, and even genetic changes which may lead to evident outside change or effects called symptoms. Some pathogens do not exhibit symptoms for their hosts are so called <em>asymptomatic</em>. Pathogen types are of the following:<ul><li><a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#bacteria>Bacteria</a><li><a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#fungi>Fungi</a><li><a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#parasites>Parasites</a><li><a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#viruses>Viruses</a></ul><h3 id=bacteria>Bacteria<a aria-label="Anchor link for: bacteria" class=zola-anchor href=#bacteria>§</a></h3><p>Bacteria (singular: bacterium) are microscopic pathogens that reproduce rapidly after entering the host. Bacteria are usually harmless but when they multiply inside the body, they produce toxins that can cause illness. Not all bacteria are pathogenic. Some are essential within the human body such as <em>Lactobacillus reuteri</em> and even <em>Eschirichia coli</em>.<h3 id=fungi>Fungi<a aria-label="Anchor link for: fungi" class=zola-anchor href=#fungi>§</a></h3><p>Fungal infections and diseases usually happen when the host's immune system is weakened e.g immuno-supressed, immuno-compromised.<p>Disease results when fungi accidentally penetrate host barriers or when immunologic defects or other debilitating conditions exist that favor fungal entry and growth.<h3 id=parasites>Parasites<a aria-label="Anchor link for: parasites" class=zola-anchor href=#parasites>§</a></h3><p>A parasite is an organism that lives on or in a host organism and gets its food from or at the expense of its host. There are three main classes of parasites that can cause disease in humans: protozoa, helminths, and <em>ectoparasites</em>. The first two are considered to be <em>endoparasites</em> as they live inside their hosts. <em>Ectoparasites</em> live outside their hosts. Tapeworms are endoparasites; mosquitoes and fleas are ectoparasites.<h3 id=viruses>Viruses<a aria-label="Anchor link for: viruses" class=zola-anchor href=#viruses>§</a></h3><p>A virus is an infectious particle that multiples only inside their host's cells. They are contagious and can spread fast. Viruses themselves are not alive in a sense since they do not contain the necessary machinery and characteristic for which we define life as "alive". The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by a coronavirus called as <strong>SARS-CoV-2</strong>.<h2 id=mode-of-transmission>Mode of Transmission<a aria-label="Anchor link for: mode-of-transmission" class=zola-anchor href=#mode-of-transmission>§</a></h2><p>There are many ways of how disease spreads.<ul><li><strong>Direct Contact</strong>. Pathogens spread through direct contact from an infected host e.g. kissing, sexual intercourse, coughing (as <strong>droplet transmission</strong>).<li><strong>Indirect Contact</strong>. <ul><li><strong>Fomites</strong>. Pathogens that live longer on surfaces can still infect new susceptible hosts e.g. door knobs, garbage cans, smartphone screens<li><strong>Vectors</strong>. Some pathogens live inside other organisms that target their hosts as well e.g. mosquitoes , ticks and mites.<li><strong>Airborne/Aerosol transmission</strong>. Some infectious agents stay in the air (as aerosols) for long periods of time to infect new hosts.</ul></ul><hr><h3 id=disease-vectors>Disease Vectors<a aria-label="Anchor link for: disease-vectors" class=zola-anchor href=#disease-vectors>§</a></h3><p>A disease <strong>vector</strong> or just <strong>vector</strong> is an organism that spreads disease by infecting the host organism as a <a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#parasites>parasite</a> or spreading the pathogen through physical contact by picking up small infectious agents.<p>Diseases transmitted by vectors are called <strong>vector-borne</strong> diseases. Many of these vector-borne disease are <em><strong>zoonotic diseases</strong></em> which are diseases that can be transmitted directly or indirectly between animals and humans.<p>Vectors are classified based on how they spread disease. In reality, some of these modes of transmission are in combination, and not just one mode. For instance, a <a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#biological-vectors>biological vector</a> may also spread the disease just through <em>physical contact</em> which is what a <a href=https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/lecture/mc1-epidemiology/#mechanical-vectors>mechanical vector</a> would do. There is a distinction but they are not really set in stone.<p>The problem with vector-borne diseases is that their transmission modes can spread through vast distances. Even humans can be considered vectors as was seen on how COVID-19 spread with our existing technological marvels for travel e.g. aviation, seafaring, land vehicles.<h4 id=biological-vectors>Biological Vectors<a aria-label="Anchor link for: biological-vectors" class=zola-anchor href=#biological-vectors>§</a></h4><p>Biological vectors are organisms carrying pathogens within their bodies where these pathogens reside and multiply. Mosquitoes, ticks and mammals infected with rabies are examples of biological vectors.<h4 id=mechanical-vectors>Mechanical Vectors<a aria-label="Anchor link for: mechanical-vectors" class=zola-anchor href=#mechanical-vectors>§</a></h4><p>These are vectors that spread disease through physical contact. Flies may spread infectious agents from their surroundings to unsuspecting hosts by salivating on food, shedding skin or touching the host.<h3 id=portals-of-entry-and-exit>Portals of Entry and Exit<a aria-label="Anchor link for: portals-of-entry-and-exit" class=zola-anchor href=#portals-of-entry-and-exit>§</a></h3><p>The portal of entry refers to the manner in which a pathogen enters a susceptible host. The portal of entry must provide access to tissues in which the pathogen can multiply or a toxin can act. Often, infectious agents use the same portal to enter a new host that they used to exit the source host.<hr><h2 id=host-pathogen-cycle>Host-Pathogen Cycle<a aria-label="Anchor link for: host-pathogen-cycle" class=zola-anchor href=#host-pathogen-cycle>§</a></h2><p>This cycle is a simplified description of how pathogens infect their host.<h3 id=transmission>Transmission<a aria-label="Anchor link for: transmission" class=zola-anchor href=#transmission>§</a></h3><p>Pathogens can be transmitted from person to person through various routes, such as direct contact (touching, kissing, sexual contact), indirect contact (contaminated objects, water, food), or airborne transmission (through respiratory droplets).<h3 id=colonization>Colonization<a aria-label="Anchor link for: colonization" class=zola-anchor href=#colonization>§</a></h3><p>Once a pathogen enters the host's body, it must attach to and colonize the host's tissues. Some pathogens can survive in the host's environment without causing disease, while others require specific conditions to colonize.<h3 id=invasion>Invasion<a aria-label="Anchor link for: invasion" class=zola-anchor href=#invasion>§</a></h3><p>After colonization, the pathogen can invade host cells and tissues, causing damage and triggering an immune response. Pathogens may produce toxins that damage host tissues and organs or cause inflammation, leading to symptoms such as fever, pain, and swelling.<h3 id=replication>Replication<a aria-label="Anchor link for: replication" class=zola-anchor href=#replication>§</a></h3><p>Pathogens can replicate inside host cells, producing more infectious particles that can spread to other parts of the body or be transmitted to other individuals. The host's immune system responds to the pathogen by producing antibodies and other immune cells to fight off the infection. The pathogen may evolve to evade the host's immune defenses, leading to chronic infections or recurring episodes of disease.<h2 id=the-pathogen-disease-progression>The Pathogen-Disease Progression<a aria-label="Anchor link for: the-pathogen-disease-progression" class=zola-anchor href=#the-pathogen-disease-progression>§</a></h2><p>This section explains what a pathogen does once it infects the host.<h3 id=incubation-stage>Incubation stage<a aria-label="Anchor link for: incubation-stage" class=zola-anchor href=#incubation-stage>§</a></h3><p>During this stage, the pathogen enters the host's body and begins to multiply. The host does not yet show any signs or symptoms of the disease. The length of the incubation period can vary depending on the type of pathogen and the host's immune system<h3 id=prodromal-stage>Prodromal stage<a aria-label="Anchor link for: prodromal-stage" class=zola-anchor href=#prodromal-stage>§</a></h3><p>During this stage, the host begins to experience mild symptoms, such as fatigue, headache, or fever. These symptoms are not yet specific to the disease, but they may indicate that the host's immune system is starting to respond to the pathogen<h3 id=acute-stage>Acute stage<a aria-label="Anchor link for: acute-stage" class=zola-anchor href=#acute-stage>§</a></h3><p>During this stage, the disease reaches its full intensity and the host experiences the characteristic symptoms of the disease. The pathogen has replicated and spread throughout the host's body, causing damage to tissues and organs. This is the stage when the disease is most contagious and can spread to other individuals<h3 id=convalescent-stage>Convalescent stage<a aria-label="Anchor link for: convalescent-stage" class=zola-anchor href=#convalescent-stage>§</a></h3><p>During this stage, the host begins to recover from the disease. Symptoms gradually disappear, and the host's immune system fights off the remaining pathogen. In some cases, the pathogen may remain dormant in the host's body and cause a relapse of the disease at a later time.<h1 id=some-factors-that-increase-chances-of-disease-spread>Some Factors that Increase Chances of Disease Spread<a aria-label="Anchor link for: some-factors-that-increase-chances-of-disease-spread" class=zola-anchor href=#some-factors-that-increase-chances-of-disease-spread>§</a></h1><p>Outside factors have an important role in increasing the chances of disease spread. These include the environment such as a hospital setting, or societal problems such as overpopulation. Here are the major factors that increase chances of disease spread.<h2 id=antimicrobial-resistance>Antimicrobial Resistance<a aria-label="Anchor link for: antimicrobial-resistance" class=zola-anchor href=#antimicrobial-resistance>§</a></h2><p>The dependence on antimicrobial drugs have increased drastically within a span of five decades since the inception of penecillin. This is a growing problem because microorganisms can adapt faster to these drugs and become resistant to it. The concern for <em><strong>superbugs</strong></em> emerging from this day and age is a threat to medical care and drug manufacturers.<p>Mitigations exist by focusing on improving the host's immune system's response to infections rather than attacking pathogens through chemical warfare. Soaps and other productsfor various purposes are now required to not put antimicrobial components into their products as they may increase the chances of emerging antimicrobial resistant microorganisms.<h2 id=overpopulation>Overpopulation<a aria-label="Anchor link for: overpopulation" class=zola-anchor href=#overpopulation>§</a></h2><p>As the human population around the world is growing at an exponential pace, the chances of infecting thousands and millions of individuals from various pathogens have increased as well. Not only that, but some pathogens have more time to evolve within subsets of populations and may become a threat in the future.<h2 id=habitat-destruction>Habitat Destruction<a aria-label="Anchor link for: habitat-destruction" class=zola-anchor href=#habitat-destruction>§</a></h2><p>As we keep on destroying the environment for more space, we are stepping closer to unknown diseases that where never known to infect humans.<h2 id=climate-change>Climate Change<a aria-label="Anchor link for: climate-change" class=zola-anchor href=#climate-change>§</a></h2><p>Same as above, but happens globally. Climate change introduces changes as well on new vectors of diseases that are normally seen in the wild. As we invade more and more and change the global biosphere, we are in for ourselves for a questionable future in health and emerging diseases.<hr><h1 id=review>Review<a aria-label="Anchor link for: review" class=zola-anchor href=#review>§</a></h1><ol><li>Cite an example for why it's important to remove antimicrobial components on skin products.<li>Some bacteria are normally non-pathogenic.
