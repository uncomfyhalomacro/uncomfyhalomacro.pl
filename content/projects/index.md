I put all my projects and ideas here. They are either dead or active. Mostly dead to be
honest.


## Rypper {#rypper}

[rypper](https://rypper.uncomfyhalomacro.pl) is a package manager written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) with the goal of being an alternative package
manager for [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org). It may work with other RPM-based distributions. As it stands, it is still
a _**work in progress**_. I consider this project to be active development.


## Waylight {#waylight}

[waylight](https://github.com/waycrate/waylight) is a brightness and gamma control tool for X11 and Wayland. The goal of this project
is to allow me to learn [Zig](https://ziglang.org). This may also let me understand how udev and sysfs stuffs work on
Linux.


## SBOL3.jl {#sbol3-dot-jl}

[SBOL3.jl](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/SBOL3.jl) is a [Julia](https://julialang.org) project of mine that I postponed because of my lack of time to understand
and create a multiple dispatch equivalent of the OOP nature of the [SBOL3](https://sbolstandard.org/) specification. I have an
idea on how to approach it now. I will probably resume writing it once I got my ideas clearly.


## qoi.cr {#qoi-dot-cr}

[qoi.cr](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/qoi.cr) is a [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org) implementation of the [Quick OK Image Format](https://qoiformat.org), also known as QOI.
The project is still in an unusable state though, but the necessary stuffs are there so anyone
can just use those.


## sbol3.cr {#sbol3-dot-cr}

[sbol3.cr](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/sbol3.cr) is an attempt to implement [SBOL3](https://sbolstandard.org/) in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org). I haven't written a single line of code
for this one yet.


## wlroots.cr {#wlroots-dot-cr}

[wlroots.cr](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/wlroots.cr) is an attempt to write [wlroots](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots) bindings in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). No single line of code yet.


## wayland.cr {#wayland-dot-cr}

[wayland.cr](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/wayland.cr) is an attempt to write [Wayland](https://wayland.freedesktop.org/) bindings in [Crystal](https://crystal-lang.org/). No single line of code yet.


## Amnion {#amnion}

[Amnion](https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro/amnion) is attempt to write an ActivityPub client for Mastodon or any compatible implementation
in [Rust](https://rustlang.org) using the [Iced](https://iced.rs/) GUI library. No single line of code yet.


## copyme {#copyme}

[copyme](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/copyme) is a clipboard utility for linux. No single line of code yet.
