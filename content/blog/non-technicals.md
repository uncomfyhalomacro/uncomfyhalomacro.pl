At least 2 years being part of open source, I feel like I am witnessing an
age where the future of open source and its movement is uncertain. Open source
has come a long way where computing has become openly accessible for everyone
and I mean desktop computing. However, most non-technicals are not aware or at
least unfamiliar with open source and the organizations that advocate for it.

<!-- more -->

Non-technicals are those that are slightly technical but not technically
literate enough.  We will call them that on this blog.

Non-technicals only buy their computers without an inkling of what rights
they have and what they can actually do to both software and hardware.

Should we discriminate them because they don't know? Of course not!

But should we leave them unaware?

# The problem with the current status quo

Currently, the world of desktop computing is dominated by Microsoft and
Apple[^osmarketshare]. If we include mobile as a form of "desktop" computing
of which, *it actually is*, then Google's Android takes a huge part of the
pie[^pie] as well.

What does this mean? These companies have won the desktop and mobile market
and it is no surprise. Their thorough marketing and research — knowing
what the non-technicals think and want — _convenience is a luxury_.

Is it bad though? Depends. Then what is?

## We own your data

All of these companies know that most people want things free. I mean who
doesn't 🥴.

Anyway, this means that non-technicals are willing to believe that these
companies come with good intentions. That's actually... too good to be true.

There are a lot of cases, news, leaks, whistleblowers, et cetera about these
things and I have no need to mention them *because I am lazy*.  One good
example is how we browse the web and a comic explainer[^contrachrome] has
a better explanation than I am.

TLDR; you are paying companies your data for advertisers from your search
history, your keystrokes, or even through your alexa.

Trying to protect yourself through incognito mode in a chromium-based browser
won't help as well[^incognito].

But non-technicals are unaware of those. So what are we going to do? Obviously,
it is to educate them right? That's easy to say, hard to execute.

There are so many blockers that at this point, it is nearly impossible to
pointless to fix. *Or we are conditioned to think that it is impossible
to fix*.

# Once a culture, always a culture

Humans have a tendency to create in-groups and out-groups. It's part of our
nature as we are social creatures (someone still has to cite that for me,
thanks!).

Once a "norm" is created, it's hard to leave that norm. One good example is
the Philippines unrelenting and always near 100% of the population using
Facebook *and* TikTok from old to young, from rural parts of the country
to the noisy urban cities, there is always that one guy or girl that cannot
stop thinking of posting a new dance.

Given the easy access of [short bursts of dopamine
addiction](https://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2018/dopamine-smartphones-battle-time/),
it is no wonder that around the world, most people are staring at their
screens watching unproductive things.

Thus, a culture of using a new form of dopamine addiction rose and became
the new norm.

Companies already knew this and exploit this kind of addiction, I kind of
wondered why that is not illegal such as how they manipulate psychology just
for profit[^fbisevil].

I am also one of those users but discovering Linux and OSS during the early
days of COVID19 saved me. Quite ironic that a pandemic made me rediscover this.

# Change or be left out

A good case for this is my family and I. There are times I want them to contact
me through Signal or other forms of privacy-respecting communication. But
it never went through.

Most people that actually know the truth including me, are afraid of being
left out.  I still use Facebook, and Discord. I sacrifice my privacy in the
name of having connections.

Is it bad though? Probably.

Will I risk chance to keep in touch with
friends? No.

This is why even most of us OSS advocates are not **purists** and pushing us
to become a purist means losing friends, and ease of communication between
family members.

I am not hopeful that there will be a chance to change that. And I don't
believe we have the power to change what has become a *necessity*. Correct
me if I am wrong. :)

# Advocate but don't be pushy

Rather than pushing non-technicals, we *slowly* educate. We share what we use,
what we do, and answer what curiousities they have about OSS.

Pushing will only literally push them away from the possible interest they have
about our lives, and about OSS.

## ActivityPub may have made it possible

Given the state of social networking and the boom of
[ActivityPub](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActivityPub) instances, I think
there is a chance we can introduce more people to OSS.

One good example is the controversial issue of federating with Meta's
*Threads*.

I have mix-feelings with ActivityPub instances federating with Threads
and there are a lot of people that actually do not like to federate with
them[^metabadfediverse] [^fedipact]. I actually lean more of **not wanting
to federate**.

Other content creators are more or less pro-federation of Threads because
some of their arguments are like these:
- your posts are public, anybody can scrape your information. _Fair enough_
- this allows us to increase exposure of OSS to the non-technicals. _Good point but I will stay observant_
- increase exposure means making people aware and may allow them to move over to OSS. _Hmm okay_

But it so happens that the current [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/)
instance I am in, [Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org), is openly federating
with Threads.

However, this *might*[^unsure] be the only way to show non-technicals
the existence of Open Source and its movement. _Big MAYBE_ I guess.

# The current state of non-technicals and us

To be honest, there is a lot to do to shorten the gap between the technicals
and the non-technicals. One example is our tend to gatekeep and have
elitist-like tendencies to push curious non-technicals who are new to
OSS. And there are a lot of norms on the technicals' side of things about
desktop computing e.g.  GUI vs CLI, that may cause non-technicals to never
use OSS alternatives at all.

Our chance to change our behaviors and our approach is always now, the
present. And to do that is to sympathize and empathize with new users rather
than barking at them for no good reason.

We should raise awareness and be open to alternatives. In today's age,
visible presence is key to allow more adoption of OSS to non-technicals.

[^contrachrome]: This maybe for Google Chrome but it also applies to any company known for their shady practices. Link to comic - [https://contrachrome.com/ContraChrome_en.pdf](https://www.npr.org/2023/12/30/1222268415/google-settles-5-billion-privacy-lawsuit).

[^metabadfediverse]: I share the same sentiments like this link [https://bu.noblogs.org/reasons-why-meta-joining-the-fediverse-with-threads-is-very-very-bad-and-how-to-save-the-fediverse/](https://bu.noblogs.org/reasons-why-meta-joining-the-fediverse-with-threads-is-very-very-bad-and-how-to-save-the-fediverse/).

[^fedipact]: There is a huge group of instances that do not want to federate with Meta's Threads called [Fedipact](https://fedipact.online/).

[^unsure]: I am still wary about Meta but I do hope this allows exposure of OSS to the masses.
