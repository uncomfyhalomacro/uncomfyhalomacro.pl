So last year, I decided to write and create a blog site because I thought I can start writing my thoughts during my free time. It's probably now in the wayback machine ðŸ¤·.
[zerm][zerm] was my fav zola themes but well, I really kind of wanted to make my own theme.

## What I learned

I thought it was easy, and actually while writing this, it's never in its final form yet. I have to learn the Tera syntax and templating engine just to understand 
how to create themes for zola. Pretty sure there were some breaks here and there. It's fun but damn, it took me a lot of braincells and internet searches just to get
what I want.

## Conclusion

Since this is just a short blog post, I will just end it here. It's just me giving my reason for writing a new blog site with a new theme I created.
If you want to take a look at the source code of the theme, you can find it in [https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro/jera](https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro/jera).
