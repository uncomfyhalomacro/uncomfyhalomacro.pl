My initial plan before I finished my undergraduate studies is pursue the
field of biotechnology and bioinformatics. I was fascinated by computer
science since I was grade 9 in high school. I was mediocre for a scholarship
grantee but I still have one of the okay-ish grades when it comes to those
subjects. I also chose statistics and computer science as my elective courses
during my senior high years.

However, because of family influence, they encourage me to take medical school.
It's not bad actually because I really also love biology that is why it is
my major pursuit since younger years ago.

But everything changed when the pandemic happened.

# COVID19 and my crappy laptop

November 2019, human civilization was threatened by a new novel virus... anyway
let's skip that part. Sounded like from a cringe novel ðŸ¤£

Anyway, November happened, so everything about school went online. I do not
care much about the speed of my laptop before because I just do everything
at a computer shop. I usually go to the computer shop to play games or do
my assignments.

But when online class came, I noticed that my laptop isn't as fast
anymore... and showed some signs of wear and degradation. From laggy typing to
10 seconds of waiting for the web browser to turn on to the modern requirements
of RAM which is now 8GB or so, it was not a great online school experience.

But fortunately, from some random memory where I tried my friends laptop
when we were grade 10, I remembered it used to run an old Ubuntu distribution
before it was replaced with Windows. I don't know where my friend got it but he
told me it was from a relative or family friend that lives outside the country.

And it made me think, "What's the current state of the Linux desktop?" ~~Real
answer is it's getting better but still not there yet~~. So I searched online
about "stable" Linux distros.

## Welp, first distribution I used was Debian.

I initially want to try Ubuntu, but I realized that I have to try something
vanilla. Why not try the granddaddy!? *Okay okay, I watched a lot of videos
and tutorials for a week before I installed....*

I readied my USB drive and downloaded the Debian ISO. Not going to lie,
I love Debian's logo. I feel like I used it before during my elementary
years without knowing.

I don't remember the difficulty about the installation but I just followed the
documentation from my phone and everything went well. Installer looks dated
but it worked. And my initial DE of choice was KDE Plasma.

# I borrowed my cousin's desktop computer.

It was more powerful and it runs on Windows. But I used it for my
[Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org) beta subscription. I was one of the
beta testers at that time and I used that opportunity to learn their Python
track. Because Hyperskill is also a Jetbrains product, I also used IntelliJ's
PyCharm.

I think I did two months of doing Python
solving and making projects â€” [nostalgic first
commit](https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/JetBrains-Academy/commit/2987555de103091f27d4f4eb220e447f8c903109).
During that time, I was not part of any language community. I was on my own
learning. It was only two months after that I then joined Python Discord.

# Curiosity continues

> My plan is to become a Microbiologist as well as a Data Scientist that
can manipulate large datasets and present research data in an informative
way.

That aged well :woozy_face:. That ***was*** my initial plan but I discovered
lots and lots of technologies and languages, everything about my initial
plan went to the drain and so I explored around a lot. Do I still consider
that plan?  Well I don't know. Maybe just some statistics review maybe then
I am good to go again I guess?

However, I am quite interested in exploring more and more. I got interested
with Wayland, newer languages such as Julia, and then Rust ðŸ˜Ž.

## I joined the Humans of Julia community

![first-hoj-message](/assets/photos/first-hoj-message.png "A screenshot of my first message when I joined Humans of Julia Discord Server")

Hence, began my Julia journey. Got so excited about the language that I did some puzzles on [Exercism](https://exercism.io) for a month. I was enthusiastic to help out a lot of newcomers as well.

~~But it died suddenly but that is for another story ðŸ™‚~~

## I joined the Rust train

Then I hopped over to the Rust train, kept on watching videos of how cool
the language is and how cool I am knowing Rust ðŸ¥´ ~~of which I only have
surface-level knowledge~~. I was supposed to learn C next but Rust happened
so uh yeah.

<details> <summary><em>Well this also happened</em></summary> <blockquote>There
was a slight problem on that year after continually learning how to program. I
don't know why but my ex, who was my girlfriend since my first year of
undergrad suddenly wanted to break up with me. I guess it was around June 2021
that we finally separate ways ðŸ˜„. I never told my family about her because
my family used to hate the idea of me being in a relationship. It took me
until 5-6 months to recover from the breakup. To my fam, if you read this,
I apologize if I did not tell you sooner. But don't worry, I have already
moved on and doing what's best for me now ðŸ¤—.</blockquote> </details>

## I joined openSUSE

[Well I don't really like repeating myself](../16). Tldr, I became a packager
and learnt a lot about distributing software.

Thanks to [Firstyear](https://github.com/firstyear) for helping me out and
teaching me about good behavior as a software developer. I am still trying
to be the best version of myself.

# Then what happened?

I don't really like sharing my issues but maybe I shared this in hopes that some
people that have experienced it can share and I would like to tell them that
they are not alone. So yeah just click that thing :)

<details><summary>What I have felt around the time of writing this</summary>
<br><br>
To be honest, I have a lot of insecurities from very successful people. Maybe
I have impostor syndrome? I just don't feel like I am good enough despite
what I have learned. While writing this, I am still thinking "maybe I have
wasted my time learning all of these" or "maybe I am not good enough".

I am trying my best to get off of that pessimism but it just happens from
time to time.

I thank the people that helped me and gave me advice. I apologize that I
haven't fixed myself yet. While writing this, I am still feeling afraid of
what I really want in the field of IT and what I am trying to do in the future.

I hide my anxiety through my work and also from my friends. I cry sometimes
at 12AM.

I still am doing my best. Although, it will take a while. But I will be able
to recover but I don't know when but I believe I do.

If you have any advice and/or relate to what I experience and/or how you
finally overcome it, please do share. I would love to have a chat. Thanks.
