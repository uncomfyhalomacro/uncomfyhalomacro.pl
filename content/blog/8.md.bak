# Sodsfafafa...

Ever since I got first into Linux (*insert random distrohopping moments*),
I became a full-time Firefox user. The first reason was, it was usually
shipped by default. The other reasons are more like it became of a personal
belief rather than "it's better!" or "chromium sucks!".

The major reasons I use Firefox can be put into these subcategories:

- Advocacy
- Variety
- Belief
- Security?

> But where is the brief history of Firefox?

No :P

## Advocacy
