## What I did in 2022

2022 was a fine year. Only issue was I am still adjusting with the new environment
now that I was finally done with my undergrad and recently working as a university
instructor for chemistry, biology and some humanities-related subjects.

I have fun writing RPM specfiles for packaging software in openSUSE and also
learning the importance of community in Free and Open Source Software.

Languages I am fond of writing are Lua, Julia, and Rust. I did learn a bit of SCSS and
SASS while also learning how to write the Tera templating engine for Zola.

Although, my only issue was the time contraints I have with work and personal life
that I haven't really done any huge projects with those technologies. I really
wanted to write a GUI client for mastodon in Rust with iced-rs but because
of the lack of knowledge of the mastodon API and Rust itself, I never really got into it.

## List of technologies I want to learn

- [Erlang][erlang]
- [Crystal][crystal]
- [Kanidm][kanidm]
- [Nushell][nushell]

I will write what I learned so far each Saturday since that's the only day that I am free, unfortunately. ðŸ˜”
