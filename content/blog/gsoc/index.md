Our open-source organization is now a mentor organization for GSoC 2024.

We would like to thank openSUSE for vouching our application which increased
our chances of getting accepted as a mentoring organization.

Thanks a lot Douglas DeMaio and William Brown!

Our application was spearheaded by our founding organization member, Aakash
Sen Sharma, a very talented individual who is going to have a new research
soon on artificial intelligence and large language models. Love the effort!
