As my selection of what to learn grows, I think there will be a change of
plans and priorities. It's time to narrow down what is essential.

Currently, I am learning Rust, and will do some Go. This added more and more of
my to-do list of learning things.

# And it became unproductive

My attention span on learning stuff were getting lower and lower to a point,
I need to reassess which and which are not to learn.

Here are the list of things I need to do 

- Setting aside System Administration
- Setting aside Kanidm
- Setting aside Crystal

They're really not set aside. I can go back to them in the future if I have the time.

## Crystal is good, why not keep it?

Sadly, only a few companies I know use Crystal. 😥 Even though it's actually a more
useful language to learn and can replace Go.

# Now what should I learn

Rust will always stay. Erlang will stay. Go is added. Python will be revisited.

## Why Erlang?

Concurrency. Also, some of Go's ideas are taken from Erlang so I also need to check those as well.

## Why Python?

It's not hard to relearn. I just need to revisit it. It's good for scripts and prototyping.

## Why Rust?

Because blazingly 🚀🚀🚀 fast 😜

# What now?

Yes. I am going to watch Learn Go in 3 hours from a Humble Bundle I got last year. And then
read Thorsten Ball's Writing an Interpreter in Go. I will check out Erlang's language reference
too ☺️
