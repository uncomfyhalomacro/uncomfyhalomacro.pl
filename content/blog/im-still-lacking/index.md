Even after two years of dipping my toes to the software and programming
world, I realized that there is so much to learn. I am somewhat frustrated or
humbled that I am still not mature enough and lack the necessary fundamentals.

# What entails a "Good Programmer"?

It's a question I asked myself for a very long time. I am reading Code Craft's
book as per recommendation from someone. As of writing I am still at page 31,
chapter 2. It asked the big question that I have for a long while.

How do I know that I am a "good" programmer? Is being "good" good enough?

What even are good software practices?

## Writing documentation?

## Reading code?

## Vocabulary?

## Know how a compiler works?

## What technologies should I learn?

## What field of IT or CS should I be focusing on?

## Should I be a "Jack of All Trades"?
