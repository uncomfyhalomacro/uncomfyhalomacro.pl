As a child, I was always into the field of science. Always curious, always
wanting to explore things to find an answer to all my questions.

Now as an adult, that intensity is now a small candle rather than a roaring
flame. It is not because I do not love science anymore. But it is because
of how the world changed a lot. Or to be more accurate, I have finally
noticed what the real world is like. Living as a child was living in a bliss
of ignorance.

Priorities change when you become an adult. Fortunately, science is always
progressing, and technology is always innovating and that brings excitement
or disappointment not because science and technology is a bad thing. But
because science can be also used for nefarious purposes. That's not new.
I already know that. I am just not happy with the state of the world right now.

In my generation, of whom are born around the year 1990s and 2000s,
we have finally reached the peak of **enshittification**.  From our
internet and social networks, to the full-blown browser trackers
or spyware and advertisements that do not even make sense at all,
to the low-quality service and the not-stealing-stealing from many
subscription based media companies â€” we can see the world is now full of
nightmare-cocaine-fuel-dopamine-addicting-technology-to-false-science things.
