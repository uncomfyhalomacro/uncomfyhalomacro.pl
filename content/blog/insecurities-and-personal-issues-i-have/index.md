> i feel small but it's going to be okay
<!-- more -->

I tell myself when I feel like I can't do really anything.

As an aspiring programmer, software developer, software engineer,
and a person that a loved one can depend on, I always feel small.

A lot of my peers have gone through many successful moments in life,
and I end up comparing myself to them. And I wish I could be
like that. But I hide myself, my social anxiety, and my inner conflicts
in the realm of learning.

I yearned to become at least a successful person in life in terms of
- happiness
- financial stability
- a loving family (if possible)
- a person who gives back to the communities that help me

Do I really want to become a software engineer? Yes.
Do I really have other options? Yes.

But I want to become the former because I learned to love and hate it
with a passion, it speaks to my existence. Maybe in the future, what
I have written here will become obsolete. But at least writing this
gives me a sense of relief. At least for anyone that reads this, you
are not alone in this journey.

Everyone has their own ups and downs. I hope anyone of us can
get through day-by-day, rest when it is time to rest, and give
ample time to take care of ourselves.

But all of these insecurities, I hope these negative feelings are
temporary and push me instead to become a better version of myself.

I also am sick while writing this.
