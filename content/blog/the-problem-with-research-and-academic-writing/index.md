A [recent study](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04607.pdf) about how citations
are manipulatable have caused controversy in the integrity and honesty of
those in academia.

To be fair, the issue about academic dishonesty is not new and has been
increasing a lot over the past decade. It's not just in the Philippines;
it happens around the world.

The key issue about the article explains why it so happens

> One reason behind using these measures is the fierce competition that
scientists face when competing for limited resources such as grants,
laboratory space, tenure, and the brightest graduate students

Another thing is based on personal experience with others. A list of these
I can think of are

- the lack of review and time
- the need to finish conducting the research
- the need to publish fast

# The lack of review and time

A lot of research writing in undergraduate here in the Philippines require
you to finish it. Facebook posts about how rewarding it is that it took
them at least a year more while their classmates finish on time is not only
overlooking the fact that academia is punishing but also ignoring the wasted
time it took to be still considered *unemployed*. I am not saying you cannot
work but their is still a culture here that requires you to be a degree-holder
for you to be able to work comfortably.

Depending on your research topic, if you are lucky, your research topic may
have enough time to finish your thesis before graduation. However, not everyone
is "lucky". But it is kind of funny, isn't a research topic supposed to be
someone's interest of the subject and not a requirement to get their diplomas?

# No thesis. No degree.

To continue, it is very common knowledge that if you cannot complete your
research, you aren't able to get your diploma. Therefore, you are still
considered a non-degree.

Based on my experience, the need to finish your thesis as a requirement to
finish your degree is bogus, and error-prone.

Is it really an issue if you didn't finish your thesis? Does it make you
incompetent? Does it make you less of a human being? These thoughts came to
mind when I was in highschool.

How did this happen? Why is today's academia so problematic and broken?

# Increase of fake articles during the emergence of LLMs

Now here comes another new arising problem — **fake articles**.

As a science instructor, I have avoided written assignments to be done at home
because of how easily this technology is accessible called *large language models*.

It's a different story in academia. It is more likely that people will
use these things to complete their seemingly "scientific" articles as described
by the [article](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04607.pdf) mentioned:

> Unfortunately, the problem of citation manipulation is likely to exacerbate
in the age of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using this technology,
a scientist can easily generate a “scientific” paper, and then plant
citations as they see fit in the bibliography, e.g., to themselves or to
another scientist in return for a fee.

With how LLMs improved by the day, and how much money is burned in that
space, I won't be surprised of how many people will use that thing for
dishonest practices.

# Keep up the grind

Another issue is the need to publish, a **lot**. To still be relevant, the
pace of publishing new articles should stay consistent. It's not necessarily
a bad thing.

But there is this perverted gamified tradition that one must have at least
published as many as they can within a year just to stay relevant.

# My overall opinion

This does not entirely happen in the science community. But also in other
disciplines.

This does not entirely happen in the academic community. But it also happens
within the classroom.
