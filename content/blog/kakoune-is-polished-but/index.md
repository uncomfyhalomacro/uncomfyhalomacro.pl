Kakoune is a fantastic editor. There are many posts
that already talk about it on how it refuses the
"Vim way" of things. But I still like to talk
about it.

<!-- more -->

This is a biased post so beware :warning:

Apparently, I do believe that Kakoune's change from Vim's
verb-object model to object-verb makes it appealing
for interactive editing as compared to Vim. Why?

Because of visual feedback. I find it weird that blog
posts against kakoune's model ignores the importance
of visual feedback. Knowing what I have selected
first before pondering what to do with those selections.

It is not intuitive to "do something" and then to "tell it
what". It's like how the link to this blog post was titled
["Detractors Need to Shut Up! Vim is the Yoda of the Dev
Community"](https://analyticsindiamag.com/detractors-need-to-shut-up-vim-is-the-yoda-of-dev-community/).

And yes, Vim speaks like Yoda but with terribly inconsistence.
