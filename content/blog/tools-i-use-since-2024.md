# Editors

I am very familiar with any editor now from Emacs, to VSCode, from IntelliJ to
Vim. But my notable favorite editors are Helix and Kakoune. Visual feedback
is more convenient for me that is why I prefer the reverse mode of Helix
and Kakoune over Vim or Neovim.

# Web Browser

I still use Firefox. I have been a Firefox user for 3 years now ever since
COVID-19 happened

# Calendar

The funny thing about calendars is I always look at my phone. I guess
it is either the `cal` command or Thunderbird's Calendar.

# Note-taking

I have tried many note-taking apps. I believe that Org mode from Emacs has
potential, especially my favorite Org Roam + UI plugin,  but the fact that
it is only for Emacs is a deal breaker for me. I plan to write something
similar that is editor-agnostic and platform-agnostic. But for now, I am
using on just plain text markdown. Obsidian looks enticing though.
