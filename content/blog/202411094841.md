There are many existing documentation about deploying webpages to GitHub pages.

This guide is just a guide for those that are interested in a very manual setup.

There is already a [full documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart)
for GitHub Pages if you want the full doc experience.

Also, readers are expected that they are competent enough to know basic Git commands.

Commands used here are for Bash shell.

# Deploying a small HTML file

If you are not yet familiar with how the CI works, do not worry as you will
notice that writing CI workflows as basic as this is not that really
difficult.

To start with, you have to do the following as prerequisites.
1. Create a GitHub Account.
2. Create a repository.
3. Clone the new repository locally.

The full commands starting for step 3 are

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/simple-site
cd simple-site
```

Adjust the URL to your repository. If you prefer SSH, the full commands are

```bash
git clone git@github.com:uncomfyhalomacro/simple-site.git
cd simple-site
```

One can check that the remote for the repository is set properly by
running the following command.

```bash
git remote -v
```

By default, it's named as `origin`. Your output could look like this

```
origin	git@github.com:uncomfyhalomacro/simple-site.git (fetch)
origin	git@github.com:uncomfyhalomacro/simple-site.git (push)
```

Now that everything is setup, let's create an `index.html` at the root
directory of the project.

```bash
touch index.html
```

Open and edit it with your editor. I use [kakoune](https://github.com/mawww/kakoune).

Copy this simple HTML code below to your new file `index.html`.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
Hello World!
</body>
</html>
```

This should suffice.

## Setting Up Your PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN

To setup your **Personal Access Token** (**PAT**), you must be logged in to your
GitHub account. Then head over to <https://github.com/settings/apps>.

You should see an option "Personal access tokens". Click that button.

You should get a drop down with some options. Click "Tokens (classic)".

In the upper-right, you can see the "Generate new token" button. Click that.

You should get a drop down with some options. Click "Generate new token (classic)".

You will be redirected to either enter your password or TOTP for 2FA. Please enter
what was asked.

Name your TOKEN to whatever you want e.g. "simple-site". Feel free to set the expiration
date of the TOKEN.

You will also see a lot of scopes. Just select the one with `[ ] repo Full control of private repositories`.

This will give full control for both private and public repositories that you have.

Now on the bottom-right, click the "Generate token" button. You will be redirected with a
one time copy of the token. Copy or write it down somewhere safe.

⚠️ Be careful not to share your token once it's generated.

## Setting Up GitHub Workflows

Now, in your local repository, create a directory `.github/workflows/`.

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
```

Create a new file called `pubish.yml` at `.github/workflows/`.

```bash
touch .github/workflows/publish.yml
```

Copy the following code snippet to your `publish.yml`.

```yaml
name: Publish
permissions: write-all
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Publish static site
      run: |
        mkdir -p public
        pushd public
        cp ../index.html index.html
        touch .nojekyll
        git init
        git branch -m gh-pages
        git config --global user.email "youremail"
        git config --global user.name "yourusername"
        git remote add origin "https://yourusername:$TOKEN@github.com/yourusername/simple-site.git"
        git add -A
        git commit -m "update site page"
        git push --force -u origin gh-pages
```

Ensure you have replaced the following
- "youremail" should be your email address
- "yourusername" should be your username e.g. username for GitHub account

Be careful with the indentations as YAML can be quite confusing.

Now before pushing to your remote repository, you have to set your TOKEN
as a GitHub secret in your repository. You should head to the link like

```
https://github.com/yourusername/simple-site/settings/secrets/actions
```

Replace first the "yourusername" with your username on GitHub before
copying it and pasting it on your browser.

You will see two options once you head to the webpage
- Environment secrets
- Repository secrets
## Adding some content

Now that our theme is up, let's add some content. At the root directory of your project,
head to `content` directory. 
Choose the one with Repository secrets and click "New repository secret". You will
be redirected to a page where you will input your TOKEN. Set the name as "TOKEN".
Then paste the value of your PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN.

Once set, click "Add secret" button.

Lastly, add and commit your local changes and push it to your remote repository.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'initial commit'
git push -u origin main
```

Your site will now be at `https://yourgithubusername.github.io/simple-site`
where `yourgithubusername` is your GitHub username. You should see
a "Hello World!" on your browser.

See the source repository for how we did it at <https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/simple-site>.

# Convenient Static Site Generators

At this point, you already know how to setup and deploy a webpage. However,
writing a complex webpage with pure HTML can be tedious.

That's where *static site generators* come into the picture.

There are many popular static site generators to choose from such as
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)
- [Zola](https://getzola.org)
- [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/)

For this part of the tutorial, you are going to use zola, a simple static
site generator written in Rust.

First create a new repository named "ssg-site".

Clone it locally and change directory into the `ssg-site` directory.

An example command will look like this. This uses SSH as the remote repository.
Adjust to your configuration.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yourusername/ssg-site.git
```

Replace "yourusername" with your GitHub username.

Then you must install zola. Follow installation instructions
[here](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/).

## Initialising Zola

Run the following command at the root directory of the project.

```bash
zola init .
```

It will ask you the following questions.

For the first question

> What is the URL of your site? (https://example.com):

You should input the following format `https://yourusername.github.io/ssg-site` where
"yourusername" is your GitHub username.

The next question will be

> Do you want to enable Sass compilation?

Type "Y" then press Enter.

The third question will be

> Do you want to enable syntax highlighting?

Type "Y" then press Enter.

The last question will be

> Do you want to build a search index of the content?

Feel free to type "Y" or "N". It does not matter yet, unless in the future, you want
your site to have a search bar.

You have finally setup your Zola configuration. Now try running the command

```bash
zola serve
```

It should serve your webpage locally at <http://127.0.0.1:1111>. It might change if another
has already parked that port.

But our site is still bland. Let's proceed adding a theme.

## Setting Up Zola Theme

Zola has many cool themes. You can check the theme collection at <https://www.getzola.org/themes/>.

Let's use [anemone](https://www.getzola.org/themes/anemone/), one of my favourite themes in Zola.

At the root directory of your project, run the following command.

```bash
git submodule add "https://github.com/Speyll/anemone" themes/anemone
```

This should create a git submodule in your project.

Now open and edit your `config.toml`. It should look like the following.

```toml
# The URL the site will be built for
base_url = "https://yourusername.github.io/ssg-site"

# Whether to automatically compile all Sass files in the sass directory
compile_sass = true

# Whether to build a search index to be used later on by a JavaScript library
build_search_index = false

theme = "anemone"

[markdown]
# Whether to do syntax highlighting
# Theme can be customised by setting the `highlight_theme` variable to a theme supported by Zola
highlight_code = true

[extra]
# Put all your custom variables here
toc = true
display_author = true
list_pages = true
header_nav = [
  { url = "/", name_en = "/home/"}
]

```

Replace "yourusername" with your GitHub username. Save the file.

Your webpage will reload and it will be an empty page with a footer. The colors
are new as well because of the theme.

## Adding some content

Now that our theme is up, let's add some content. At the root directory of your project,
head to `content` directory. Create a new markdown file `_index.md`. Now copy and paste
this *Lorem ipsum* to `_index.md` file.

```
+++
title = "Lorem Ipsum"
+++

# Lorem Ipsum

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam,
quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo

## Dolor sit amet

cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat
non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.

### Consectetur adipiscing elit

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod

cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat
non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum.
```

Then run the following commands.

```bash
cp _index.md 1.md
```

To understand what these files do, `_index.md` serves as the "home" page. It will
list our posts such as `1.md`.

Now try to edit `_index.md` such as an introduction about yourself and what you do.

Then edit `1.md` with your new goals in life or tips and tricks.

Once satisfied, let's finally deploy your site to GitHub Pages.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

At this point, you can either regenerate a new TOKEN or use the previous one you
have created from `simple-site`. Let's just assume you already have a TOKEN.

First, run this command at the root directory of your project.

```bash
echo "public" >> .gitignore
```

This should ignore the generated `public` directory. You should always do this
because otherwise, you will end up having duplicated files *unless you have other
plans*. The `public` directory is only created when you run this command.

```bash
zola build
```

Next, add the new TOKEN as a **Repository secret**. You can repeat the steps you did on how to add
a new TOKEN to your repository like in the `simple-site`.

Here is the fun part. Do the following commands.

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows/
touch .github/workflows/publish.yml
```

Then edit your `publish.yml` file which is located at `.github/workflows/` with the following code.

```yaml
name: Publish
permissions: write-all
on: push

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    container: opensuse/tumbleweed:latest
    env:
      TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
    steps:
    - name: Checkout
      uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        zypper --non-interactive in zola git
    - name: Generate static site
      run: |
        rm -rf themes/
        mkdir -p themes/
        pushd themes/
        git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Speyll/anemone
        popd
        zola build
    - name: Publish static site
      run: |
        pushd public
        touch .nojekyll
        echo "uncomfyhalomacro.pl" >> CNAME
        git init
        git branch -m gh-pages
        git config --global user.email "youremail"
        git config --global user.name "yourusername"
        git remote add origin "https://yourusername:$TOKEN@github.com/yourusername/ssg-site.git"
        git add -A
        git commit -m "update site page"
        git push --force -u origin gh-pages
```

Ensure you change "yourusername" to your GitHub username and "youremail" to the email you are using for your GitHub account.

Save the file. Now run the following command to add and commit your changes, then push.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m 'my first blog'
git push -u origin main
```

Notice that in the YAML file, it uses a custom image. That's because that
linux distribution image, Tumbleweed, already has an updated version of zola.

Once your site has been generated in the GitHub actions, you can head over to this link format
`yourusername.github.io/ssg-site` where "yourusername" is your GitHub username.

Feel free to use this or learn and use other SSGs to prettify your blogs and web pages!

# FAQ

> I noticed that you didn't use a GitHub action plugin `shalzz/zola-deploy-action@master`. Why?

If you know the process, then you can trust yourself more than some random plugin. Not saying they could not be trusted
but you have to weigh your risks
1. You already know how to deploy, then you are more sure that you can trust yourself.
2. Trust is a spectrum.

Therefore, I don't need someone's tool if I already know how to do things. It's for the security side of things since
GitHub actions can be a potential attack surface.
