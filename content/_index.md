# About me

I am uncomfy, a wannabe programmer, who likes to discuss about Linux, Wayland, and various programming languages
such as Julia, and Rust. My other interests are biology, webtoons, and anime. I have a bachelor's degree in
biology and i majored in microbiology. For now, I am currently teaching at a private university. I am
planning to shift my career related to tech but that needs some work for now. 

> Why call yourself "wannabe programmer"?

Because I have no talent and I am not a genius like Linus Torvalds or Drew Devault.

# Closing Remarks

This theme is much inspired from [zerm](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm), a really wonderful zola theme
template.
