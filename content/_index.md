# About me

I am Soc (aka ***uncomfy***) and welcome to my website! I like to discuss about
Linux, Wayland, and various programming languages such as Julia, and Rust.

I am planning to shift my career related to tech but that needs some work for now.

I have a passion for technology and biology, and currently building a career
in software development and engineering.

Currently, I am a science instructor at a private university to make ends
meet, I teach biology courses to undergraduate students, using interactive
and engaging methods to foster their curiosity and passion for science.

I am a proud member of the openSUSE community, where I maintain 22+ packages
that include tools for my organization. I have been involved in open source
software development since 2020, starting with Debian as my first Linux
distribution. I believe in the spirit of open source and its potential to
advance scientific discovery and innovation. My goal is to pursue a career in
software development and engineering or bioinformatics, where I can combine
my expertise in microbiology and programming to solve real-world problems.

I am a self-taught programmer. These are topics that interest me in terms of
recency:

- web development
- DevOps
- compilers
- functional programming
- containers
