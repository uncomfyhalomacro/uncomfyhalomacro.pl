# About me

I am Soc (aka ***uncomfy***) and welcome to my website! I like to discuss about Linux, Wayland, and various programming languages
such as Julia, and Rust. My other interests are biology, webtoons, and anime. I have a bachelor's degree in
biology and I majored in microbiology. For now, I am currently teaching at a private university. I am
planning to shift my career related to tech but that needs some work for now.
