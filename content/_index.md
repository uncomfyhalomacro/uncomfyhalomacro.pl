# About me

I am Soc (aka ***uncomfy***) and welcome to my website! I like to discuss about
Linux, Wayland, and various programming languages such as Julia, and Rust.

I have a B.Sc. Biology, majoring in Microbiology. For now, I am currently
teaching at a private university. I am planning to shift my career related
to tech but that needs some work for now.

I have a passion for technology and biology, hoping to build a career both
as a bioinformatician, a technologist and a software engineer.

As a science instructor at Misamis University, I teach biology courses to
undergraduate students, using interactive and engaging methods to foster
their curiosity and passion for science.

I am a proud member of the openSUSE community, where I maintain 22+ packages
that include tools for my organization. I have been involved in open source
software development since 2020, starting with Debian as my first Linux
distribution. I believe in the spirit of open source and its potential to
advance scientific discovery and innovation. My goal is to pursue a career in
software development and engineering or bioinformatics, where I can combine
my expertise in microbiology and programming to solve real-world problems.
