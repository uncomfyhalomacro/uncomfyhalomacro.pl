# About me

I am Soc (aka ***uncomfy***) and welcome to my website! I like to discuss about Linux, Wayland, and various programming languages
such as Julia, and Rust. My other interests are biology, webtoons, and anime. I have a bachelor's degree in
biology and I majored in microbiology. For now, I am currently teaching at a private university. I am
planning to shift my career related to tech but that needs some work for now. 

## How to contact me

You can contact me through my developer email:

## Programming Languages I am really familiar with

- [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)

## Software and things I want to familiarize with

- **Docker**. I have a bit of knowledge
- **Podman**. I use distrobox
- **Erlang**. I heard about it because of its impressive built-in concurrency support.
- **OCaml**. First FP language I want to try since a long while before I immerse again in Haskell.
- **Systemd Administration**. I am quite familiar with writing configs with system. Timers is one of
things I haven't tried yet.
- **Kanidm**. Can't. No time for that yet.
- **Nushell**. Done. Mastery is what I am lacking
- **Crystal**. No time. Need to do the others first.

# Closing Remarks

This theme is much inspired from [zerm](https://github.com/ejmg/zerm), a really wonderful zola theme
template.
