To be honest I am just writing this out of boredom. I have lots of plans
for next year and I was hoping they won't go awry, at least.

<!-- more -->

So my plans are probably the following:

- slowing down maintenance cycles as a packager.
- improving my knowledge of Wayland.
- improving my knowledge on Julia.
- improving my knowledge on databases e.g. SQL and PostGres.
- improving my knowledge on my field of expertise once I proceed with my undegraduate studies.
- advocating for the usage of Open Source software.
- probably leaving OSSPH once 2024 ends.

# Slowing down maintenance cycles as a packager

It has been 2 years since I started packaging for software for [openSUSE](https://get.opensuse.org).
I have fun but it has taken a lot of my time to fix, to add patches, and to update versions of packages
that I even sometimes forget what is the most important. For now, expect that I will mostly focus
on updating packages related to Rust, Wayland, and Julia. I hope there are contributors out there who
can fill that time gap if anything important arises. Anyone who are willing enough can check out
the [wiki](https://en.opensuse.org/Category:Packaging_documentation) for packaging documentation.

# Improving my knowledge of Wayland

My knowledge of Wayland was postponed on 2023. I was planning to learn but personal time (mostly laziness)
took most of the chances to learn Wayland (and other stuff). My plan for next year is learn how to write
a Wayland client with the help of my friends on [Waycrate](https://waycrate.github.io/). I felt sorry
for Aakash doing all the work and maintenance. I am glad that there are people that like to contribute at
least. Thanks Andreas and shootingstardragon.

# Improving my knowledge on Julia

Julia. Oh yeah I forgot. This language was supposed to be my favorite language until I became a Rust fanboi.
Most of my knowledge on [Julia](https://julialang.org) is back to zero. I literally don't know anything now
about the language so it seems. I am planning to refresh next year by writing a pure Julia package for the
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-primer/) specification, a W3C standard for graph data. This is quite
related to a postponed package for SBOL3.jl. Although, writing that package after finishing for RDF package
in Julia is mutually exclusive. I can choose not to write for SBOL.

# Improving my knowledge on databases

I have little experience with databases but I can still remember some SQL since highschool. Although, I won't
say that I have like, *enough knowledge* to be able to do some stuff. I lack the experience to deploy and
integrate databases with any programming language I have tried or used. So yes, I hope 2024 allows me to
learn them.

# Improving my field of expertise

I finished my undergraduate studies on Biology specializing in Microbiology. However, it's now the time
to consider enrolling for my graduate studies probably a branch or somewhat an interrelated field. I
will check out soon next school year 2024-2025. For now, it's a plan. I still need to keep my job at
a private university.

# Advocating for the usage of OSS

For a few years, I am using a lot of OSS. From various editors to office suites and even writing this blog,
I have learned them through my curiousity and enthusiasm to learn OSS. I plan to share them to the private
university I work for by raising awareness about costs and advantages of using OSS.

# Probably leaving OSSPH once 2024 ends

I am planning to leave [OSSPH](https://ossph.org/) or ***specifically step down***. Not too sure why
(it's probably cryptocurrency and Web3). I feel like the community have little impact to what I do in my life
so I guess it's time to plan that ahead unless anything changes.

# Non-tech and non-academic related plans

I plan to get regular workouts next year even just light exercises. I am gaining weight slowly and it's kind of sad
that my plan to maintain around 64 kilograms is now nearing 72 kilograms.

I also plan to mitigate my procrastination. It's hard. And it caused a lot of woes this year. I don't know why
I procrastinate but I have a feeling it's due to my subconscious telling me "what you're doing is not worth it".
I would like to know why but I think I have an answer. It's time to tire myself out positively ðŸ«¡.

I also plan to increase my reach from various parts of communities be it tech or biology so I hope 2024 is a blast.

# So uh...

Yes. By January, I will postpone all programming activities and software maintenance unless someone emails me
that a package needs to be updated. I will resume such activities starting February.
