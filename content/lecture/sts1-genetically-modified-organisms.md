# Natural Selection

Natural selection is a known concept in the field of biology and life sciences. It talks about
how the environment change the organisms living in it to adapt and thrive in that environment. Otherwise,
these organisms are forced to move to other environments (e.g. habitats and ecosystems) or become extinct.

This concept was first recognized by Charles Darwin during his voyage to the Galapagos Islands
and co-discovered by Alfred Russel Wallace who was exploring Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, 
which ***were*** known as the *East Indies*.

## In relation to evolution 

Natural selection is the actual driving force in *evolution*, where a new species or sub-species arises
from the changes through various *adaptations*. Simply put, with enough time and luck, a species
may become another species if it wants to *adapt* in that environment. A new species may or may not
be able to breed with its ancestral species, and if it can, it is usually sterile or infertile e.g.
a cross between a donkey and a horse produces a sterile hinny or mule.

### Confusions about evolution

There is a confusion caused by many traditional biologists about "missing links" and "transitional forms"
in regards to evolution. The confusion is caused by the misinformation such as "humans came from 
chimpanzees" and whatnot. The truth is, every species is actually a transitional form. There is no
actual specific point when it comes to evolution. It's always dynamic. Each of us may become an ancestor
or a predecessor of some species we will never know. We can only define ourselves as "closest relatives"
with chimpanzees but no such thing as a "common ancestor", just the "closest ancestor".

This is not the fault of scientists. It's just that scientific communication sometimes simplify concepts a
bit that it may cause confusion.

### Evidence

Evolution is not that clear to see at first because our perception time is not the same as evolutionary 
time. The effects of natural selection takes thousands to millions of years for it to be noticeable.

The only way we can observe this is through *fossils*. Fossils are petrified remains of dead organisms 
that can span even millions of years.

Fortunately, we can observe natural selection in *microorganisms as they reproduce fast*. In the modern 
age, we can observe this by reading articles about antimicrobial resistance in some species of 
bacteria or even experimenting it inside the laboratory.

# Artificial Selection

Artificial selection is one of the greatest evidence of natural selection. Except it's not caused by
nature, but through careful selection of traits from us, human beings. We have practiced this concept
without knowing it for thousands of years from domestication to agriculture. Dogs, cows, and corn
are such examples of artificial selection. Through selective breeding, we achieved the desired traits
we want from these organisms. Another such good example would be the *Brassica oleracea* species because
people will not expect that cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower are actually the same species!

# Genetically Modified Organisms

As we achieved the ability to modify and select genes, the field of *bioengineering* and *genetic
engineering* has paved the way of accelerating our ability to quickly select the traits we want from 
different organisms for food, raw materials, and medicine or drugs. These organisms are so-called 
*genetically modified organisms* or GMOs.

## Food Security and Safety, and Agriculture

As the world population grows exponentially, there is also an increasing demand of food production
and also an increase chance of a new disease affecting those that consume and those that are consumed.

Genetically modified organisms with the power of genetic engineering can mitigate or even remove
those threats to food security and safety. Genetic engineers and geneticists can look for the gene
that increases food production or increases resilience against disease. Sometimes even add another
trait of that GMO to have a specific nutrient or nutrients to fight malnutrition in poverty-stricken
regions. Some crops can be even modified to be resilient to the effects of climate change such as flood
resilient rice or salt resilient fruit trees.

## Medicine

GMOs can help us produce or increase the quality of our medicine. It may also help us find new ways
or new kinds of medicine to produce. Insulin for example were already produced by genetically modified
bacteria, specifically, *E. coli*.

GMOs are more consistent and don't carry the same risks than traditional medicine because they can be
lab produced, therefore, has more of a controlled setting. We can genetically modify organisms to be
resilient or produce the drugs for us such as insulin, or even vitamins that are commonly deficient
in young people.

# Review

1. List 5 things that are the result or product of GMOs.
2. Are GMOs bad or good? Explain.
3. How does genetic engineering help us mitigate the effects of climate change?
4. List down at least one species of plant that was saved from extinction
   through genetic engineering.
