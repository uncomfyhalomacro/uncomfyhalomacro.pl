The **immune system** is a host defense system and comprises many biological
structures ranging from white blood cells to entire organs.

The function of the immune system is to protect the host against foreign invaders
called *pathogens*. Pathogens can be anything from a virus, to a bacterium, and even
a multicellular parasite including cancer cells.


# Layered Immunity

There are two subsystems of the immune system:

- [innate immune system](#innate-immune-system)
- [adaptive immune system](#adaptive-immune-system)

These subsystems provide a *layer of defenses* against pathogens that keep our body
lessen the chances of infection or further damage if otherwise.


## Innate Immune System

The innate immune system usually begins with the physical barriers that prevents
pathogens from entering the body. These includes our own skin barrier, mucus
membranes and the acidity of the stomach.

## Adaptive Immune System
