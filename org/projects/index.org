I put all my projects and ideas here. They are either dead or active. Mostly dead to be
honest.

* Rypper

[[https://rypper.uncomfyhalomacro.pl][rypper]] is a package manager written in [[https://rust-lang.org][Rust]] with the goal of being an alternative package
manager for [[https://get.opensuse.org][openSUSE]]. It may work with other RPM-based distributions. As it stands, it is still
a /*work in progress*/. I consider this project to be active development.

* Waylight

[[https://github.com/waycrate/waylight][waylight]] is a brightness and gamma control tool for X11 and Wayland. The goal of this project
is to allow me to learn [[https://ziglang.org][Zig]]. This may also let me understand how udev and sysfs stuffs work on
Linux.

* SBOL3.jl

[[https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/SBOL3.jl][SBOL3.jl]] is a [[https://julialang.org][Julia]] project of mine that I postponed because of my lack of time to understand
and create a multiple dispatch equivalent of the OOP nature of the [[https://sbolstandard.org/][SBOL3]] specification. I have an
idea on how to approach it now. I will probably resume writing it once I got my ideas clearly.

* qoi.cr

[[https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/qoi.cr][qoi.cr]] is a [[https://crystal-lang.org][Crystal]] implementation of the [[https://qoiformat.org][Quick OK Image Format]], also known as QOI.
The project is still in an unusable state though, but the necessary stuffs are there so anyone
can just use those.

* sbol3.cr

[[https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/sbol3.cr][sbol3.cr]] is an attempt to implement [[https://sbolstandard.org/][SBOL3]] in [[https://crystal-lang.org][Crystal]]. I haven't written a single line of code
for this one yet.

* wlroots.cr

[[https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/wlroots.cr][wlroots.cr]] is an attempt to write [[https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots][wlroots]] bindings in [[https://crystal-lang.org/][Crystal]]. No single line of code yet.

* wayland.cr

[[https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/wayland.cr][wayland.cr]] is an attempt to write [[https://wayland.freedesktop.org/][Wayland]] bindings in [[https://crystal-lang.org/][Crystal]]. No single line of code yet.

* Amnion

[[https://codeberg.org/uncomfyhalomacro/amnion][Amnion]] is attempt to write an ActivityPub client for Mastodon or any compatible implementation
in [[https://rustlang.org][Rust]] using the [[https://iced.rs/][Iced]] GUI library. No single line of code yet.

* copyme

[[https://github.com/uncomfyhalomacro/copyme][copyme]] is a clipboard utility for linux. No single line of code yet.
