        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/i-will-say-this-again-science-is-not-an-issue-intent-is/">&lt;p&gt;As a child, I was always into the field of science. Always curious, always
wanting to explore things to find an answer to all my questions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now as an adult, that intensity is now a small candle rather than a roaring
flame. It is not because I do not love science anymore. But it is because
of how the world changed a lot. Or to be more accurate, I have finally
noticed what the real world is like. Living as a child was living in a bliss
of ignorance.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Priorities change when you become an adult. Fortunately, science is always
progressing, and technology is always innovating and that brings excitement
or disappointment not because science and technology is a bad thing. But
because science can be also used for nefarious purposes. That&#x27;s not new.
I already know that. I am just not happy with the state of the world right now.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my generation, of whom are born around the year 1990s and 2000s,
we have finally reached the peak of &lt;strong&gt;enshittification&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.  From our
internet and social networks, to the full-blown browser trackers
or spyware and advertisements that do not even make sense at all,
to the low-quality service and the not-stealing-stealing from many
subscription based media companies â€” we can see the world is now full of
nightmare-cocaine-fuel-dopamine-addicting-technology-to-false-science things.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
