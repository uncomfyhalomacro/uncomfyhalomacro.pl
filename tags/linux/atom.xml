&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I stopped using it&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;. MicroOS has some of it&#x27;s perks but the current state of the operating system is still in it&#x27;s beta&#x2F;alpha state
so some moving parts are inherently broken. It&#x27;s probably because of the lack of contributors and interest from SUSE and openSUSE
for the desktop variant of MicroOS. As much as I want to become a contributor, I realize I lack the time to do so because
of work and personal problems and issues I still have to fix a lot in real life. If you still want to know how I use it, continue reading.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;hr &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MicroOS Desktop is a &lt;em&gt;desktop variant&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of the openSUSE&#x27;s MicroOS for servers and containerized workflows. Please do note, although they are
similar, they are separate products and have different goals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Issues in MicroOS for server should be issued over there and issues in MicroOS Desktop
should be on MicroOS Desktop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the desktop is as follows:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;immutability&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;isolation of system and user software&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;containerized workflows&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;immutability&quot;&gt;Immutability&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#immutability&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: immutability&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutable desktops are nothing new. Windows and MacOS are immutable desktops since &lt;em&gt;you cannot
change the core part of the system&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; unless you have some permissions and workarounds to do it e.g.
modifying the system registry. For years, this was the standard of modern OSses including Android.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditional desktop linux and nix systems are &lt;em&gt;mutable&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; which means that the user can modify
each part of the core system. Although this advantage is also a disadvantage, nothing is perfect.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;advantages-of-an-immutable-system&quot;&gt;Advantages of an immutable system&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#advantages-of-an-immutable-system&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: advantages-of-an-immutable-system&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being immutable is inherently an advantage of an immutable desktop system. It is hard to
modify the core part of the system and updates are &quot;atomic&quot; which means the whole system
will update as an immutable system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Users are encouraged to use workflows through sandboxing or containers. In this case, &lt;strong&gt;flatpaks&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;,
&lt;strong&gt;nix&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;distrobox&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;toolbx&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;docker&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;podman&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For desktop software, it is advisable to use flatpaks. &lt;em&gt;Some users do use toolbx and distrobox for this&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For development environment, they are encouraged to use distrobox and toolbx. Others may prefer nix.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;disadvantages&quot;&gt;Disadvantages&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#disadvantages&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: disadvantages&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being immutable &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;may&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; also be a disadvantage. It&#x27;s very self-explanatory. You cannot modify
your system as much as you like to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#security&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: security&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immutable desktops increases security of the core system since it&#x27;s not welcoming any modifications.
Since the root file system is read-only, it&#x27;s not easy to tamper the system and thus, users
can avoid any vulnerabilities &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;unless the vulnerability is from the package and software installed
from the root file system&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-workflow&quot;&gt;My Workflow&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#my-workflow&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: my-workflow&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For software that I want to use e.g. Firefox, flatpaks are the way to go. Flatpaks are the best
when it comes to these kind of distributions as they are self-contained and do not pollute
the host system with ridiculously brittle and large dependencies when installing through
the system&#x27;s package manager.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developing and packaging software and also for learning, and note taking, I use distrobox.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;how-i-use-distrobox&quot;&gt;How I use distrobox&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#how-i-use-distrobox&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: how-i-use-distrobox&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I created &lt;code&gt;mainbox&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; executable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;distrobox&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt; enter&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; -&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;n&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; tumbleweed &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-group z-expansion z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-variable z-shell&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-language z-shell&quot;&gt;@&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is for my development environment such as notetaking, learning a new language, or programming tasks.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also created &lt;code&gt;rootbox&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; executable.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;pre data-lang=&quot;bash&quot; class=&quot;language-bash z-code&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-comment z-begin z-shell&quot;&gt;#&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;!&#x2F;usr&#x2F;bin&#x2F;bash&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-comment z-line z-number-sign z-shell&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-source z-shell z-bash&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-function z-shell&quot;&gt;distrobox-enter&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; --&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;root&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt; --&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;name&lt;&#x2F;span&gt; opensuse-build-service &lt;span class=&quot;z-meta z-group z-expansion z-parameter z-shell&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-punctuation z-definition z-variable z-shell&quot;&gt;$&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;z-variable z-language z-shell&quot;&gt;@&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;span&gt;&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;&lt;&#x2F;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is for openSUSE Build Service related stuff since I am a volunteer packager there. I also set
the &lt;code&gt;--home&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag when creating this podman container. The &lt;code&gt;--home&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; flag helps you have a custom
&lt;code&gt;$HOME&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; inside your container. It avoids clutter on your &lt;em&gt;actual home directory&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, I am still new to MicroOS Desktop and I still experience some bugs here and there because
I use the KDE Plasma variant of MicroOS which is known to be still in it&#x27;s &lt;strong&gt;alpha&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; stage. This
means, it&#x27;s not yet considered for daily use &lt;em&gt;even though some users are now using it&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. To help
improve the experience, it&#x27;s best to file bug reports and propose suggestions to the MicroOS
Plasma Desktop maintainers and contributors. If you are privileged to have the free time to
contribute, consider offering your skills and services as well.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Install all the &lt;code&gt;xdg-desktop-portal&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; implementations especially gnome and gtk. Blurry fonts are usually affecting
gtk apps and not qt apps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NVIDIA drivers don&#x27;t load as fast causing some issues with the login manager. Workarounds is a force &lt;code&gt;systemctl restart display-manager.service&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;.
I am not sure what&#x27;s causing it as there are no logs. This does not happen on vanilla openSUSE TumbleWeed.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/12/"/>
        <id>https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/12/</id>
        
        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/12/">&lt;p&gt;Ever thought of what linux distribution to choose? You are not alone.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux (or GNU&#x2F;Linux for the pedant 😛) has at least hundreds of different existing distributions. This
gives users many distributions to choose from and the freedom to use their distribution of choice. This
includes the popular distros such as Fedora, Ubuntu, openSUSE, and Linux Mint and the most obscure such
as Carbs Linux, Clear Linux, and some Arch derivative you never heard of before.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this can also be confusing to newcomers (or even old users) alike because your distro of choice
can really matter when it comes to community support, maintenance, and also the life of the distribution
before it f itself out of existence. This means that choosing the wrong distribution can result to
unintended consequences for you as a user for areas in e.g. security, community, and support.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nearly&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; happened with &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsol.us&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Solus&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; btw. The two posts summarizes what happened:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SolusProject&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ssps5j&#x2F;i_no_longer_feel_safe_using_solus&#x2F;&quot;&gt;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;SolusProject&#x2F;comments&#x2F;ssps5j&#x2F;i_no_longer_feel_safe_using_solus&#x2F;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;getsol.us&#x2F;2023&#x2F;04&#x2F;18&#x2F;a-new-voyage&#x2F;&quot;&gt;A New Voyage - Solus Project&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing it&#x27;s back 😄. I don&#x27;t use Solus though. But what can we learn from this btw as a user? And how
does this affect our decision to choose a distribution? Is choosing a distribution really matter?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, the short answer is &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;yes&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. You can skip btw but if you want to read more I have some
important points to take why this is so.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;your-distribution-of-choice-really-matters&quot;&gt;Your distribution of choice really matters&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#your-distribution-of-choice-really-matters&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: your-distribution-of-choice-really-matters&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s painfully obvious that your distro of choice really matters. There are many factors to consider
when choosing a distro. Choosing the &quot;right&quot; distro for you is very subjective but here are the factors
you really need to consider:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncomfyhalomacro.pl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;12&#x2F;#documentation-and-wiki&quot;&gt;Documentation and Wiki&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncomfyhalomacro.pl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;12&#x2F;#community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncomfyhalomacro.pl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;12&#x2F;#software-availability&quot;&gt;Software Availability&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;uncomfyhalomacro.pl&#x2F;blog&#x2F;12&#x2F;#longevity&quot;&gt;Longevity&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;documentation-and-wiki&quot;&gt;Documentation and Wiki&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#documentation-and-wiki&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: documentation-and-wiki&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this first mentioned than the other sections? Because good documentation and a wiki can help both
old and new users to hop over a distro. Badly written or no documentation at all can be a reason why
certain distros will never have any new users at all. Beginner-friendly distros are &quot;beginner friendly&quot;
for a reason. That&#x27;s because they have good documentation on how to install, use, and maintain their
system. Even hard-core &quot;do it yourself&quot; distros such as Arch or Gentoo are popular because they have
an informative Wiki where anyone can contribute or improve existing information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A special mention for &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.freebsd.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;FreeBSD&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, as it is one of my favorite non-linux
distribution with great &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;docs.freebsd.org&#x2F;en&#x2F;&quot;&gt;documentation and manual&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Easy to understand and grasp.
Sadly, I really cannot daily drive it because some software work only on Linux. I do hope you try it out!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;community&quot;&gt;Community&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#community&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: community&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What makes a Linux (or a BSD) distribution stay alive for years and years? What keeps it afloat? And what
keeps it thriving still in the future?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s actually the community behind your favorite distribution.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing interest and usage of a distribution helps maintain motivation from both project contributors and
community members. However, incentives are actually needed to keep both the distribution and community thriving.
This is shown to be true to most &lt;em&gt;corporate&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;community&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; backed distributions such as Fedora (from RHEL),
and openSUSE (from SUSE). With no incentives such as funding and through donations, it is really hard
for a community to stay alive, and again, this nearly happened to Solus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is important as well in choosing your distribution because you are given the assurance to stick to that
distribution without worrying that it will someday become a dead project and a dead community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;software-availability&quot;&gt;Software Availability&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#software-availability&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: software-availability&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is very self-explanatory really. Your distribution of choice may not have the software you use when you were
in another distribution. This can be fixed by helping contribute to the distribution itself by volunteering to
package the software you usually use. I don&#x27;t think there should be an issue about that but it is up to you
if you have the time to do that. No one is forcing you to contribute. The idea of giving back should be encouraged
though.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, packaging formats such as &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;flatpak.org&#x2F;&quot;&gt;flatpak&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;snapcraft.io&quot;&gt;snap&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; bridge the
issues with software availability. I definitely recommend flatpak over snaps though as flatpaks are &lt;em&gt;truly
platform-agnostic&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; unlike Canonical&#x27;s snap 🤮. No to AppImage, I will write a blog about that soon.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;longevity&quot;&gt;Longevity&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#longevity&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: longevity&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How long does a distribution last? New distributions are born nearly every year or so but the question remains. What
keeps a distribution&#x27;s existence last for decades?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is very simple. Time and money. Unfortunately, free software is not actually free as you would like it to be.
Contributors and project maintainers alike need some form of incentive for them to keep a project alive. *They gotta eat
and sleep too you know...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small time distributions rarely last a year or two before they become dead (insert another Arch-derivative meme here).
These kinds of distros rarely last because there are no incentives and additionally, they are usually hobby projects or
projects that only focus on a niche.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporate-backed &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; community-backed distros are on the clear because they have the means and incentives to do so.
It is also why I always recommend distributions such as Fedora or openSUSE.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choosing a Linux distribution can be confusing. Sometimes joining the popular is the safest option to take. Other times, you
just want to try obscure distros just to be different. To be honest, preference is preference. Whether you like pineapple
on pizza or not, it is up to you to choose a distro. However, ignoring the factors I mentioned to choose a distribution that
you want to use daily can affect your productivity and time. If you really want to try out a distribution and test it out,
I suggest run it inside a container or virtual machine. Explore and hop around until the shoe fits 😀.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not really a fan of fighting over which operating system people use, but I do hate
Arch elitists because most of them are morons.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;my-introduction-to-linux&quot;&gt;My introduction to Linux&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#my-introduction-to-linux&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: my-introduction-to-linux&quot;

&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I became a linux user since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic because I need to have a working computer that
works with the slowest hardware which was a Lenovo IdeaPad with Intel i3 (two cores with SMTP) and 8GB RAM.
I forgot the exact spec, but it was around there. But I think I am not like other first time users. Instead
of going with Ubuntu as it is the most popular distro, I started with Debian stable. And yes, of course it has
outdated packages which for me at that time was not relevant as I only need it for mundane tasks such as
writing documents and moving files around. After a few months, I distrohopped to Kubuntu, Xubuntu, Artix, Manjaro
and on the New Year of 2021, I hopped to Arch and stayed there for 6 months. The reason I found myself in
rolling release distros is that I want to have the latest bleeding edge software. However, the desktop
experience between different release models seems to be similar nor different. Because the fundamentals of a desktop
is for it to be used as one with the most basic of software. However, I am not saying there are no flaws
using Linux as a desktop.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;linux-as-a-desktop&quot;&gt;Linux as a desktop&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#linux-as-a-desktop&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: linux-as-a-desktop&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desktop Linux is not as popular. However, just because it&#x27;s not as popular, it does not mean that it is not usable.
During my first time using Debian and ignoring the fact that the installer menu is very dated, the desktop experience was alright and I have not experienced some funky
things except that the software there is always outdated in Debian stable. Given the simplicity of my use cases
for a desktop e.g. web browsing, writing documents, and moving files around, it seems using Linux as a desktop
is not really a problem for me. But for those that want to use Photoshop, well tough luck, you are on your own
as those proprietary software do not really support linux. But hey, if you have old hardware, Linux is your only
choice unless you want to try the BSDs.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;okay-so-are-there-any-problems&quot;&gt;Okay, so are there any problems?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#okay-so-are-there-any-problems&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: okay-so-are-there-any-problems&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No software is perfect nor any concept is ideal. Free and open source software is one and this affects desktop
Linux adoption.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;desktop-linux-is-dependent-on-the-desktop-environment&quot;&gt;Desktop Linux is dependent on the Desktop Environment&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#desktop-linux-is-dependent-on-the-desktop-environment&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: desktop-linux-is-dependent-on-the-desktop-environment&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t simply not emphasize this one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your desktop environment in Linux can actually determine your overall
desktop Linux experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A desktop environment in Linux is basically a set of desktop tools from related toolkits that create a full
desktop experience. Popular desktop environments include&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;KDE Plasma. Based on the QT Toolkit.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GNOME. Based on GTK Toolkit&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XFCE. Based on GTK as well.&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why is this important? Because some users blame the distribution of Linux that they&#x27;re using instead of
the desktop environment. And thus, they can be deceiving for newcomers because newcomers will think distro X is bad
because distro Y has this, when they are actually just comparing GNOME over KDE Plasma.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having many choices is a double-edged sword, it&#x27;s the same on desktop environments&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But it does not mean we should just keep it at that. We should educate newcomers that it&#x27;s the desktop environment
they are looking and not the distribution. So instead of suggesting them to &quot;use Arch linux&quot; just for the superiority
complex, suggest them KDE Plasma and tell them GNOME sucks because it does not have a system tray. *Pitch forks flying where?*&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another disclaimer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;: Just because I hate this part of GNOME, does not mean I hate GNOME as a whole. It&#x27;s just a joke with added
hint of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;linuxiac.com&#x2F;gnome-background-apps&quot;&gt;truth&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; 😛&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my take here is, use the desktop environment you are more familiar with and you find the most intuitive to use.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;software-availability-can-be-brittle&quot;&gt;Software availability can be brittle&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#software-availability-can-be-brittle&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: software-availability-can-be-brittle&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing I like about Linux is the amount of software availability. Want an office suite? Use Libreoffice.
Want an image editor? Use GIMP or Krita. And there is no end to it. I think this in my opinion is what makes
Linux a good choice in using it as a desktop. However, although it&#x27;s an advantage, remember that we are talking
about &lt;em&gt;free&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; software. And free software can be &lt;em&gt;brittle&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-problem-with-free-and-open-source-software&quot;&gt;The problem with free and open source software&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-problem-with-free-and-open-source-software&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: the-problem-with-free-and-open-source-software&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h4&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freedom and free can be easily overly used and abused&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be. I appreciate the efforts that are put into these software. But I have my reasons for why being
free can be a problem.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software availability does not equate to software quality&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes. Just because it&#x27;s available, it does not mean you get the quality you want like from proprietary software
as well. Proprietary software can be low quality though. However, what I am saying is that, it is hard
for FOSS to achieve similar quality unless there are incentives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Money, is undoubtly, one of the driving force to keep FOSS alive through funding. I remembered reading
an article stating that GNOME was close to dying because of the lack of funding.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But you are a FOSS enthusiast right?&quot;, I am and hear me out. I think the issue about being free
is the fact that most people interpret &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; as in &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;free beer&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. This means that people who
contribute and&#x2F;or maintain FOSS software does not need any incentive... but oh boy they do 🥲. Lots of software
are very slow to update, slow bug fixes which some can even span for a decade or two (yes that&#x27;s true lmao), and
even gets abandoned because people do not contribute and just selfishly demand the maintainers without thinking
that they made this software on their free time... And that free time is not compensated well enough &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;and free
time is not free&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; unless you are privileged enough. These factors lead to cause some open source maintainers
to drop their project or become hostile to their users which promotes a toxic environment for both users and
maintainers. Overall, these issues affect the overall quality of the software, hence why people prefer PhotoShop
over GIMP. Desktop environments are software as well so they are not excluded when it comes to these issues.
There are certain instances where a certain kind of desktop environment is very hostile to users.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Free is &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; free beer&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&quot;But you just linked two?&quot;, dude I am not your nanny, formulate your own opinion by doing research and thru observations.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&quot;But this is Linux as a desktop?&quot; and they are related to desktop Linux adoption 🙂.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;adoption-of-desktop-linux-is-slow-because-reasons&quot;&gt;Adoption of desktop Linux is slow because reasons&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#adoption-of-desktop-linux-is-slow-because-reasons&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: adoption-of-desktop-linux-is-slow-because-reasons&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my take for why it is slow.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people are tech-savvy enough to appreciate open source software and make Linux as their daily
driver and I kind of understand that. However, the reason the normies can&#x27;t use Linux is that
the workflow, the setup, the software availability and the installation method for some software are
unfamiliar to them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, desktop Linux is more centered around seasoned developers and enthusiasts rather than
the common people. And most people buy computers with pre-installed operating systems &lt;em&gt;which of course is &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;MacOS&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; given that
Linux has a very small marketshare (around 1-2%). Those operating systems were designed
&lt;em&gt;for those people&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and it is no surprise that desktop Linux will stay as obscure for another
decade or so &lt;em&gt;unless they use the Steam Deck&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;proprietary-and-non-linux-software&quot;&gt;Proprietary and non-Linux software&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#proprietary-and-non-linux-software&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: proprietary-and-non-linux-software&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also an issue with using Windows software. Most of them are proprietary.
As most software for normies are targetted mostly for the two most popular operating systems,
Windows and MacOS, some users have to go to various workarounds just to get their favorite software
to work e.g. running through an emulation layer or through Wine or Proton.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a bit annoying for those that do not want to learn those things as they want things to get
done asap.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my honest opinion though, this is not the fault of Linux. It&#x27;s more of like &quot;We don&#x27;t want to include
Linux builds for this X software because we generate less money there&quot; so it&#x27;s a bit understandable
because capitalism. *cough cough*&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;is-it-now-normie-friendly-then&quot;&gt;Is it now normie friendly then?&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#is-it-now-normie-friendly-then&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: is-it-now-normie-friendly-then&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That kind of depends. Even the most desktop user friendly Linux distributions are not completely normie
friendly, starting from the installer to a fully installed setup. But I have to say that
it kind of is. Linux has come so far from being a developer and an enthusiast only operating system
to somewhat close to general user desktop operating system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#x27;s kind of fortunate that there are an increasing number of enthusiasts and volunteers to
create (or fork) Linux distributions and design them in a way that even those with little to no
technical knowledge can install Linux. One good example is Linux Mint, Ubuntu, and Fedora and some
Arch forks such as EndeavourOS and ArchCraft. However, the issue also arises &lt;em&gt;during&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; desktop usage
where users complain about installing drivers, codecs, and other stuff that requires at least
some technical know-how to fix&#x2F;install&#x2F;debug them. So much for an out-of-the-box experience.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I am not going to say it&#x27;s fully normie friendly but there is evidence of progress. This is
my honest opinion that desktop Linux requires a lot of patience and workarounds just to make it
work sometimes.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, I have to install the flatpak software for my girlfriend
since it&#x27;s the fastest way to get codecs built-in to the software e.g. Firefox. My girlfriend is
not a developer nor a programmer nor a tech enthusiast. Thus, I have to make her openSUSE
installation as sane for her as much as possible.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;fyi&quot;&gt;FYI&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#fyi&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: fyi&quot;
  &gt;§&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, &lt;em&gt;I don&#x27;t use a desktop environment as much as I used to&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, I always often use a tiling window manager such as
SwayWM, RiverWM, and Hyprland. For me, it can be considered a desktop linux experience (so you can only blame yourself for having bad configuration or setup).
However, these are for enthusiast power-users that like to configure everything down to the source code (such as DWM) and our topic
is about desktop Linux for the normies so it&#x27;s irrelevant.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
