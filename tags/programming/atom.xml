        <content type="html" xml:base="https://uncomfyhalomacro.pl/blog/learning-state-machines/">&lt;p&gt;While rewriting
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;openSUSE&#x2F;obs-service-cargo_vendor&quot;&gt;OBS Service Cargo&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; in Rust, I was thinking of how the logic
be represented clearly. Here and there, I thought I was done but after
reading my code, I was like, damn this looks awful. And then my mentor came
in to give me hints through his code comments in Discord and from his code
reviews on GitHub. He gave me a link of his talk for PurpleCon, a volunteer
conference for some hackers in Oceania and NZ?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer was right in front of me all along! I was just too
focused on the tech jargon that I got lost.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State machines exist in nature too. In many ways, cells and their
components use some form of &lt;em&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to signify a certain kind of
action, the same way microwave ovens have a state when to turn off
e.g. if you open the lid or turn off the power, and when to turn
on e.g. when to turn the knob to the right and start the timer.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hormones, and other forms of cell signalling tell cells what to
do. Something damaged? Just release histamines to let other immune
cells know you are damaged.  Are you high on glucose? Oh crap,
produce more insulin!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;state&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; of your body also can cause some &lt;em&gt;form of action&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.
And life does this to achieve homeostasis and other forms of
biological actions such as defending against a predator or migrating
to another area to get more food.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I always like think each function is a particular organelle or a cell in a
software system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each module is a tissue&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each set of modules interrelated of each other is an organ&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And these organs form an organ system, thus, forming an organism.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar, if not the same, as how software is written.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;State machines&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt; exist and we just get used to it that we forget they exist around
us.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we think each component has a set of states, it&#x27;s easier to imagine the logic of
many components of your program.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;rust-is-one-of-the-perfect-language-to-imagine-anything-as-states&quot;&gt;Rust is one of the perfect language to imagine anything as states&lt;a class=&quot;zola-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#rust-is-one-of-the-perfect-language-to-imagine-anything-as-states&quot; aria-label=&quot;Anchor link for: rust-is-one-of-the-perfect-language-to-imagine-anything-as-states&quot;
  &gt;ยง&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rust has types and enums that can be over(ab)used to think of important components
to have some set of states. I like this part of Rust where I can just slap an
enum defining a state or condition and just use it all over the code base for
things that actually make sense to have it. Even the &lt;code&gt;Option&lt;&#x2F;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Result&lt;&#x2F;code&gt;
types can be thought of as a &lt;em&gt;state of having something&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; and a &lt;em&gt;state of
having something that does not bite you&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

  &gt;ยง&lt;&#x2F;a
&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is just a short post to remind myself how powerful it is to use state machines.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
